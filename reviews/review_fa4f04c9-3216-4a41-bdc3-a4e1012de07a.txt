UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln In the three years that I have attended I have had nothing but a wonderful time there. I have always felt safe on campus and the professors are always willing to meet with students. The only down side would be the dining hall food. Other than this I couldn't have wished for a better place to complete my undergraduate degree.
