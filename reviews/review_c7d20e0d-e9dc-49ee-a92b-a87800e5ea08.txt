"MichiganStateUniversity Albeit recent events, MSU is still a great school. It isn't perfect, but no school is. I do feel that more focus should be put into academics and building up our facilities instead of feeding into the already strong athletic culture here. And the salaries are pretty unfairly handed out here. But we still attract an all star cast of instructors. I feel that I am learning from very qualified professors that do have my best interest in mind. 
With better management of money, I believe MSU can become an excellent university."
