"NorthwesternUniversity Northwestern is an excellent place to grow as a student, both academically and extra-curricularly.  Smaller class sizes and accessibility of faculty and staff are helpful in setting students up for success.  While athletics are not the main focus of the campus culture, students still rally around the teams and revel in the occasional ""Cinderella"" season.  Greek life is not the only means of becoming involved on campus.  There are a variety of student-run organizations that are active in campus life, anything from radio, to journalism, to theatre and music.  For bright, motivated students, Northwestern is a terrific place to pursue higher education."
