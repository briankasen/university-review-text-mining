"OhioStateUniversity The Ohio State University solely captured my attention and became home immediately following the first visit; the environment was completely unfamiliar to me, but resonated with an aura of comfort and belonging.  Both faculty and students have been a pleasure to be around and have made efforts that go above and beyond my initial expectations.  My only hindrance with the school comes in the form of tuition; however, there are plenty of opportunities for financial aid."
