"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I think that the UMN has lived up to the expectations that I had going in, being that it's more like a small city than a normal college campus - it's huge.  There are of course both positive and negative aspects about this, as you will never be able to experience everything it has to offer, but at the same time it has almost every available resource, to the point where I'm sick of getting emails offering new programs. Even though many say that the class sizes are large, I've found that many of my more specific courses have had as little as 10 in them. So I believe that the UMN is pretty good, at least by my standards."
