"MichiganStateUniversity I think Michigan State University is an excellent place to be. The environment is extremely welcoming from the students to the professors. My advisers always help with any questions I have, and my professors are always willing to stay after class or set up meetings if I had any troubles. There are many clubs and activities to do- on and off campus. There is no other school I would rather be."
