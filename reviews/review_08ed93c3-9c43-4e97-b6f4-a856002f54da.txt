"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign To this point, the University of Illinois has provided me with a valuable education. The teachers and professors are very caring and they take time out of their own schedules to teach the material outside of main lecture times. The student life, a lot of the time is very dependent on  drinking however there are still a variety of activities for students to get involved in."
