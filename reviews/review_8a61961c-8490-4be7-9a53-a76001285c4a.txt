"NorthwesternUniversity I had an amazing time at Northwestern, inside the classroom and outside. The school excels in so many areas - journalism, theatre, engineering, etc - and you get to mingle with all of them. My fraternity was a very positive experience, and I loved living in Evanston; close enough to Chicago to enjoy the city, far enough to enjoy a high quality of life."
