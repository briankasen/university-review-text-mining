"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor I honestly feel that this is the best school in the world. The balance of academic and social aspects of college is perfect. Resources and/or facilities for any kind of endeavor are readily available at all times. The wide range of options for public transportation is very convenient. The weather a little cold sometimes, but that is overshadowed by how great other aspects of the University are."
