"PurdueUniversity The campus is beautiful with many outdoor places to meet between classes to enjoy when its warm. There are also plenty of indoor spaces to hang out, get food, or even a beer on specific days. People are always nice and the atmosphere is welcoming. Game days are the absolute best days on campus, with people and events everywhere! Overall a great college to attend or even visit for fun events."
