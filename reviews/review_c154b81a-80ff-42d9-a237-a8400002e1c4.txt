"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign When I first got to the campus, I was amazed by the sheer size and then the amount of people that were here. It was a completely new experience. I had found that if you don't invest yourself into some form of club here, this feeling will quickly wear off. I suggest walking around the campus and getting to learn everything that is here."
