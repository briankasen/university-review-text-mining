IndianaUniversityBloomington I have completely enjoyed my time at Indiana University and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well rounded and great college experience. It excels in academics as well as having so many things to do outside of class. The faculty and staff truly care about the students and everyone in the IU community works hard to make it feel inclusive and safe.
