"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Great school to get involved. There are hundreds of opportunities available for students to participate. From sports all the way to dance clubs, to Latin arts and many more. Facilities around campus are very diverse definitely a place to get out of your comfort zone. The school has 4 different campuses you will have a hard time adjusting at first but easy to get used to. Great scenarios. And a lot of fun all year around."
