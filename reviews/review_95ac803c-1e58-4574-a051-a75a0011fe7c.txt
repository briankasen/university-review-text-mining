"Rutgers-universityNewBrunswick As an alumnus of the 250th class of Rutgers University, I am proud to call myself a Scarlet Knight. Over four years, I propelled through many academic and social experiences, that I will cherish for years to come. I quickly learned that YOU make your Rutgers experience; you get what you put in. I chose to participate in dance teams, medical brigades, and an animal welfare club! Rutgers is known for its eclectic student population- with international, commuting, nontraditional, and disadvantaged students, Rutgers is definitely a ""melting pot"". Rutgers is also a renowned research institution, with well established mentors and teachers. With that being said, some of the professors (at least in the science field) seem more interested in their own research than they are with teaching.  At Rutgers, many of the 1st and 2nd year class sizes consist of 400 students, so you have to go to office hours, take advantage of tutoring, and make study groups to succeed. By my last two years at Rutgers, my upper level science classes dwindled down to a size of 50-100 students, which allowed me to get to know my professors well. Overall, my experience at Rutgers, both socially and academically, was one of a kind and something I will forever for grateful for."
