"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Among my top choices is UMN-Twins Cities, which was a suggestion given by my former manager at AbbVie, who claimed UMN-Twins Cities had one of the best PhD programs in chemistry in the U.S. Upon further research, I could confirm this to be a fact. Studying at UMN-Twins Cities is an amazing opportunity to learn and also produce high quality science."
