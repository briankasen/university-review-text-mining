"MichiganStateUniversity It's a great school that provides every opportunity to help you strive academically and socially. Professors exceed expectations and really help students succeed by having consistent office hours as well as adjusting their schedule for students. MSU is composed of many places that give access to academic help and social events. Dorms are clean and organized and the dining halls provide a variety of high-quality food. Off-campus living is also pretty affordable, near campus and many restaurants/stores."
