"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The moment my 16-year-old self set foot on this beautiful campus, I immediately felt an almost innate sense of belonging. More than drawn to its incredible resources and world-class academic community, UIUC welcomed me as my future second home. A year there has already gone by too fast, and I am enthralled with the idea of three more years full of amazing experiences."
