"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Penn State is not for everyone. It is a very big place that people often get lost in. For me, it has been a dream fulfilled. The academics are great and the sports are to die for. I met my best friends in the first week of class and take full advantage of everything the school has to offer. I love this place and wouldn't go anywhere else."
