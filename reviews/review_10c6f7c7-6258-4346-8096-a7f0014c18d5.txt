"PurdueUniversity My overall opinion of Purdue is that it is an excellent school. It offers many opportunities and can make any college dream come true. With tons of majors, Purdue is a school that can work for any person. Although there are 41,000 students at Purdue, the atmosphere is super friendly and the school feels much smaller."
