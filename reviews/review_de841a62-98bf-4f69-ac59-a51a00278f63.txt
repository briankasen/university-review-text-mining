"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan is a well known home to outstanding academics, Coach Harbaugh, and overwhelming creativity.  While many other colleges have superior academics, athletics, or creativity in a specific field, rarely do you find a school that has all of these things so strongly bound together and at such a high level of piercing excellence. It is the unique balance of these components that so many other schools lack, and it is what truly makes my university the Victor."
