"PurdueUniversity It is amazing how many people attend Purdue University. It makes our college extremely diverse which allows students to learn more about other cultures and Purdue offers many different program just for that. I also love the variety of different class you can take as electives. It broadens your mind to appreciate other subjects other than your specific major. Overall I love attending Purdue, there is so much that people can get involve in to be part of a great community and become a Boilermaker."
