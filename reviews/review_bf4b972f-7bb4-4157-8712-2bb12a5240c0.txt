"NorthwesternUniversity My transition from high school to college was difficult. I allowed my fears of failure and anxiety about the future to get the best of me. I struggled with the rigorous pace of coursework during my freshman and sophomore years. As a lifelong Girl Scout, I never give up and am not afraid to ask for help. As I adjusted to the workload and began taking courses more aligned with my interdisciplinary interests, my passion grew and my grades improved. My perseverance, preparation, and confidence allowed me to succeed during my senior year and get into a great graduate school. Knowing what I know now, the advice I would give my high school self would be to relax and stay confident. I am smarter than I give myself credit for and it is easy to forget that when I spend most of my time in classes surrounded by incredibly intelligent individuals. Additionally, I sometimes get distracted by the overwhelming nature of the courses and forget to live my life. I would tell myself to remember to hang out with friends and watch a movie once in a while, because spending all of your time studying just leads to more stress."
