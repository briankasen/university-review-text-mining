"UniversityOfIowa I love the school! It's a very welcoming environment and the school is committed to making diversity a priority on campus. Everyone loves the team and we get excited for big games, and there's always people around campus and downtown studying, having fun, and stimulating intelligent conversations. The art community is amazing, as is the LGBT community on campus. The only thing that could change is that some of the buildings could use a little bit of a face lift."
