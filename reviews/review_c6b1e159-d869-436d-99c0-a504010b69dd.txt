"MichiganStateUniversity Michigan State University is a beautiful huge campus with various activities and student organizations to become involved in.  I am a freshman at MSU and I am involved in several organizations such as their Step Program, the Trio Program, I volunteered for The Welcome Team and this is where you help incoming and returning students move into their dorms in August.  There is a perk of moving in prior to everyone else.  I also hold a college work study position on campus and I attend various seminars on campus.  The class at MSU are great and can be challenging at times, however MSU have great professors that really do care about your performance. MSU helps you to build a network of people and have an enjoyable college experience.  MSU is a diverse community with students form many different backgrounds who come together to form one of the most extraordinary and productive colleges and learning experience you could ever have. I absolutely love Michigan State University and don't want to go back home, because I consider MSU my home now.  I live in a quad dorm and that's the only quad dorm on campus and I have no problems with my 3 roommates, we barely see each other due to our busy schedules.  Michigan State is the place to be GO GREEN GO WHITE is our saying at Michigan State University. Make MSU Spartans your home."
