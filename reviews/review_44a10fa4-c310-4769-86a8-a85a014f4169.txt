"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark I enjoy the University of Maryland. There are a lot of fun things to do, but it is a large campus so you have to really strive to meet new people. The most obvious part of this school is the number of students. There are a lot of people everywhere, so sometimes its hard to meet your professors or get the help you need."
