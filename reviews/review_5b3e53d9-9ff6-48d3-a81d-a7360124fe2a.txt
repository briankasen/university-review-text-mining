"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska-Lincoln was not a school I original planned on attending, however I was filled with immediate love for the passion seen at this prestigious school. Lincoln itself is a city of its own, filled with life at all hours. Whether its licking ice cream at Ivanna cone, or seeing a Husker basketball game at Pinnacle Bank Arena. Students are seen all over the city and all over campus, sitting at coffee shops or on the Union lawn with professors having intellectual discussions. The school is a community full of opportunities. Greek life is a major part of my life, allowing me to meet hundreds of new faces and grow relationships that will last a lifetime. Outside of Greek life, University of Nebraska-Lincoln has hundreds of clubs. From major related clubs, to fun in the sun, every student has a chance to find their home. The passion and connections UNL has is shown together at Husker football games on bright fall Saturdays. Over 90,000 people celebrate and cheer as they watch the football team score a touchdown. There's harmony in each chant, and the whole stadium is filled with joy. No other college has such a large sense of community. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln possess its own special passion for excellence in all who experience the pride of Big Red."
