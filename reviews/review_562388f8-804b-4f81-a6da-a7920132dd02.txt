"MichiganStateUniversity I had high hopes when I first started at State, I really did. For the past 6 years I have lived internationally in Hiroshima, Japan and Shanghai, China and was so excited to study at a school with such a large international population. For me however, it was a tough transitoin back as I am from Michigan and am not a ""true international kid.""  I was accepted into James Madison and was  even more excited to be in a place of such open minded people, those who I could have educated and difficult conversations with. I had trouble adjusting to the patriotic views of so many of my classmates. They arent the ""I'm proud to be an American"" types, but more so, ""here is my opinion let me shove it into your face until you feel the exact same way and if you dont then we are giong to have a problem."" Their councilors do not help. I'd been struggling with how I was feeling and went to go talk to a lovely older woman, her name escapes me at the moment. All she could talk about was her grandchildren and at the end of out session she told me to just go home and get some sleep even though I went to her because I hadnt been able to sleep for abour 5 days and I always felt on edge. Their doctors at Olin aren't much help either. This may just be becuase I had a bad experience with them , but I truly wouldn't wish this on anyone else."
