"IndianaUniversityBloomington My overall opinion is that is a safe, friendly school with great sports, academic and extracurricular life. Students are genuine and there is always a smile to been seen on campus or a door being held for you. I am involved with their Kelley School of Business and it is a great institution. They have countless clubs and organizations to become involved with. Within those clubs, it is a selective process, but there are many positions for leadership roles. Also, the Greek life is big, but it is not necessary to go Greek to find friends and build a social group."
