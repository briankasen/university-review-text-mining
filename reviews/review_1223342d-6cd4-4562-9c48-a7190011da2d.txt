"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor This university is a fantastic institute for education. The student population is diverse and welcoming of others; everyone here is accepting of one another. The education is of top quality, as well as the extra-curricular activities. From the first time I visited this campus over four years ago, I had fallen in love and knew I needed to attend this school. I worked for my entire life to make it to this fine university and now I will be part of the greatest alumni program in the world someday."
