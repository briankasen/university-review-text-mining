IndianaUniversityBloomington I love IU. It's a great school academically. There is a lot to do in the town and people are very nice. Lots of classes and extracurriculars. Class sizes are big for general education classes and smaller as you get more into your major. Overall a great school with lots of things to keep you busy.
