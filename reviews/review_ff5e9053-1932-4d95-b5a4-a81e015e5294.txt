"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers university is a prestigious, research 1 school that I can say I very happy I chose to attend.  I also feel that Rutgers hasn't always been what it is to the world now. Rutgers took a long time becoming the institution it is today and is still learning and growing. I believe that is what makes it better to attend because the school is getting better as time goes on. Aside from academic rigor, I believe that the students and faculty make it worthwhile. Upon graduation, I will be better equipped than most to deal with the diverse, ever- growing and evolving society we live in today."
