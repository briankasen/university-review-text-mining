"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The University of Maryland, College Park is a pretty diverse and an unique school. One of the first things I noticed was the amount of diversity in regards to race, ethnicity, culture, and language. Its cool walking past someone speaking another language, especially when the environment caters to everybody.  The campus is huge, but they're are plenty of buses and shuttles. Through some of the schools events and organizations i've found my both my community and my place, I've also made life-long friends. As every school, it has it's pro's and it's cons, but in my opinion their pro's outweigh their cons. At the end of the day I am very blessed to be a student at the University of Maryland, and wouldn't want to do undergrad anywhere else."
