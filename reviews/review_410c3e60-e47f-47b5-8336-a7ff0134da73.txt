"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The campus is beautiful, the students are mostly friendly and engaging, and there is an overwhelming sense of team spirit. Everybody has a story to tell and the living experience feels like living in an actual town.  The food, while the variety is a little lacking, is generally pretty good and they spice up the menu with daily specials. It feels like something is always going on in the campus. The only reason the accumulative rating is not a 5 is because it is currently premature from my perspective; I have only attended for half of a semester so far. I need to gain a further understanding toward the academic side of the university and how it's handled in respect to professors, objective teaching, and a separation between material and politics and/or religion. Overall, I am very satisfied."
