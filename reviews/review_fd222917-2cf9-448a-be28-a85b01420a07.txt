"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor At first, as a freshman its a tough adjustment in such a huge environment. But once it becomes home you start to thrive. There is ALWAYS something going on in any subject matter you can think of. Literally it could be three in the morning and you can find people doing what you also want to do. However, that is not to say you can't and won't have your own quite time. There are plenty of places on campus you can make your own and overall this place has become home. Its much much more than a great academic and research institution."
