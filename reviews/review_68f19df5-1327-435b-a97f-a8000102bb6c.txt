UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I really enjoy being a student at UNL. I have only been here for two months but it has been an incredible experience so far! I have met so many new and exciting people and I have been able to participate in many different activities. There is never a dull moment here. The campus atmosphere is so welcoming and enjoyable. I love it.
