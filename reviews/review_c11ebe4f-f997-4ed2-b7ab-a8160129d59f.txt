"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Overall, Penn State is not a bad place to go for your education.  If you fit into the culture here and have the money to survive, you can thrive.  Its a huge party school where it seems athletics and Greek Life are obsessed about by mostly everyone.  From personal experience, most people would rather party than do anything beneficial to their academics.  Drinking and drugs have a much larger culture here than I could have ever imagined.  But, on the upside the school has multiple resources that if you are wise and use them, can really benefit you in life.  That also comes with a cost though as Penn State is supremely expensive and often offers no help to the student."
