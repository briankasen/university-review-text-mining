"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison It's a very white washed school. For students of ethnics minorities it's sort of intimidating to be around campus where the rest of the community is predominantly way more different than you in every aspect. The student life here Is very lively here though, there is always a party going on somewhere, football is huge here, drinking and drugs are everywhere, and the education is tough. Not a school for everyone indeed."
