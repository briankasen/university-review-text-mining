"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark It's a great school for all kinds of students. Great sports teams, hundreds of clubs, there's always something going on. It's great for engineering students like myself who utilize facilities of the campus to our advantage. The campus life is fulfilling and there are so many friendly people."
