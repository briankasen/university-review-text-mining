MichiganStateUniversity I love Michigan State!  I am a transfer student and I am so glad I came to MSU.  I transferred from a small local college where I felt it was hard to meet people.  Coming to MSU is the best decision I've made.  I feel like I belong in this community and I have met so many wonderful people.  No matter what you're into you will find people with the same interests.
