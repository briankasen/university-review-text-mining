"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities It is a good school overall. I feel that many professors are not as dedicated to the success of their students as they should be, but that is not to say that I have not had some very spectacular instructors. If you're looking for a valuable degree that will lead to future opportunities, then I recommend this University."
