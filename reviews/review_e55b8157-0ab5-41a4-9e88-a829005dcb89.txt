"IndianaUniversityBloomington Coming into college I expected insane parties every weekend and a cesspool of snooty horndogs. But, I am pleased to report that everyone here is serious about their education and seem to be more interested in building meaningful relationships and less interested in drama. College is not exactly as I expected it to be but in a good way. I could not see myself at any other college besides IU. The people are majority liberal and open minded which is a warming change from my frigid conservative hometown. IU offers so many services it really seems like they want thier students to succeed. I have yet to have a bad experience with any professors or classes at IU."
