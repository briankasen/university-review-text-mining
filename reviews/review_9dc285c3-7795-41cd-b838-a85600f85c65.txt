"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Penn State is a huge campus with a variety of resources, on and off campus. There are pros and cons to being large. I was always told you can make a large campus feel small, but not vice versa. I feel like I am in the process of accomplishing this, being  only a semester in. I am enjoying the experience and think Penn State is a wonderful place."
