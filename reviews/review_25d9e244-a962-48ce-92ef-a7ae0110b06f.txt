"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity The academics are challenging for sure, but the overall campus is amazing. You really get the college feel from the very first second you step onto the campus. I'm from CT, but this school has become my second home and I love it with the entirety of my heart. I'm so proud to be a Penn State student."
