"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Penn State is a campus with so many opportunities. While many students partake in party culture, we still excel in classes and make time for extracurricular activities. Not everyone agrees on politics, but everyone is allowed to protest or speak out about their opinions. While different life experiences can pull us apart, our love for the game brings us back together. Game day at Beaver Stadium is like no other. As we link arms and sing the Alma Mater, we forget all negativity and are one. We Are!"
