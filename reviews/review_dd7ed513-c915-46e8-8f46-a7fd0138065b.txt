"UniversityOfIowa It is wonderful, everyone says they love their school, but I truly mean it. Iowa is the best place to be at all times. The people are so nice around here, and everyone looks out for each other. I have a blast on the weekends, and learn so much in the week days. If you don't know where you want to go to college, I strongly recommend taking a look at the University of Iowa first, because then you decision will have been made simple for you. Go Hawkeyes!"
