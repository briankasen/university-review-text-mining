"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I love U of I. I think what sets it apart most, is the huge amount of companies always coming down to campus. You have a vast amount of opportunities to network with companies even starting freshman year. There are a million ways to get involved whether a sorority/frat is your scene or you just want to join a club. So much to do and great college campus feel."
