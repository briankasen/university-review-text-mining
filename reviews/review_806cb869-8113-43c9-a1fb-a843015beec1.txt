"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I have only been a student at the University of Minnesota for a few months, but to say I am in love with my school would be an understatement! I have met and made so many connections with amazing people from all over.  The campus demographic is very diverse and inclusive, there really is a spot for anyone. The campus also offers a huge variety of clubs and extracurriculars. Class sizes are much smaller than I expected and faculty is very helpful. The light rail on campus makes it very easy to find something to do whether it is a weekday or weekend. Finally, the school spirit people have for the gophers in indescribable SKI U MAH!"
