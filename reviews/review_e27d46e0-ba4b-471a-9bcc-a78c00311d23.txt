"OhioStateUniversity I really enjoy my time on campus. I was first nervous about attending such a huge campus but I have come around to love it. Although the class size may seem overwhelming, recitation classes are a lot smaller which is very helpful. The professors are always willing to help if you are willing to reach out to them."
