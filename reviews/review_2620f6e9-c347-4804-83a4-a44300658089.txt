"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska - Lincoln is a growing university. As an out of state student, it was a bit overwhelming at first because there are a lot of in-state students as it is the most popular Nebraska university, however there is a growing population of out-of-state students, and a large international community. Because of it's growth and entrance into the Big10, the university has been renovating and rebuilding facilities to state-of-the-art standards. The campus is beautiful and compact to give it the small school feel, yet offers a vast amount of clubs, activities, and sports typical of a large university. It is truly the best of both worlds for everything. You can go wrong with UNL."
