"OhioStateUniversity The Ohio state university provides many opportunities for the students to be involved. We have hundreds of student organizations available, therefore it is easy to find something one is passionate about. The class sizes however are big, but there are recitations for each subject that focuses on students learning in a smaller settings. Everything else is great at the Ohio State University. I love it here."
