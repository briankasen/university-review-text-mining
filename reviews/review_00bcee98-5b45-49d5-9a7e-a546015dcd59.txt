"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The university of Maryland was not my top choice in schools. It was a close contender but before I accepted, the University of Delaware and Clemson both held a special place in my heart.  If I am being completely honest, the major selling point for the University of Maryland was simply the fact that for me it was the best in-state school. I am currently a sophomore and so far I have not regretted my decision.  The University has decent food that is an all-you-can-eat style with unlimited access, a large (albeit crowded) gym, and some new buildings. Sadly some people end up with amazing dorms while others end up in awful ones with little space and no air conditioning. Some teachers are wonderful and approachable while others are rude and just make simple topics confusing. All that being said, UMD can be an amazing college to go to as long as you make the most of it and try hard in your classes."
