"MichiganStateUniversity The moment you step onto Michigan State University's campus, you know you are somewhere special. This is a place where the Spartan Family is everything. They want you to be involved, go to games, have fun, and push yourself academically. It is safe to say that this campus is more than just a community, but family."
