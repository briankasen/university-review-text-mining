"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I loved the UNL. It is a great university. I strongly recommend the College of Business, unless you plan on pursuing a Finance degree. There's plenty of things to do on and off campus and Lincoln's downtown is right next to campus. The dorms are nice and have plenty space, especially when compared to other universities dorms."
