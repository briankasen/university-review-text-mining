"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark University of Maryland is a great school, the professors give in depth lectures and are incredibly helpful and accessible if you do not understand material.  The classes are competitive, however if you pay attention, keep up with the work, and regularly attend office hours, you will succeed.  The only thing about College Park that I have not loved so far is the lack of air conditioning in the dorms."
