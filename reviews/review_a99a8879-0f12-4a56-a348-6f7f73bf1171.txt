"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign When I visited, I loved the campus life. A lot of people were walking around the campus, sitting in the quad or playing games outside. It seemed like a very friendly place and I saw several buildings that looked nice enough. A few of my friends go here and they love it!"
