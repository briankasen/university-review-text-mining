"OhioStateUniversity The Ohio State University is a school that is academically diverse, all inclusive, and shows pride in their campus. They have over 200 majors you can choose from.  The professors and teaching assistants are always willing to help when you need it. The students are accepting of any person regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, etc... The Ohio State University is very prideful in their campus, and they're not afraid to show it. I love going to the Ohio State University, and will always show pride in being a buckeye. Go Bucks!"
