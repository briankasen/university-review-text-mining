"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The University of Minnesota is never boring.  I love it here, for the masses of students that area always around, or the events that are constantly going on. There's always a new place to explore, either on campus or in the city. Everyone can find their niche because so many niches exist. The campus is beautiful and the academics are marvelous."
