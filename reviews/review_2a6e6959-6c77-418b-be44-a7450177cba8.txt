"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The Universtiy of Nebraska-Lincoln has made me feel welcomed and involved, despite the size. This may be a Big10 school, but the class sizes are usually around 20 to 30 students. Every professor I've had in the past has had regular office hours and is available any time by email. The University also aims to involve students as much as possible with new events offered on a weekly basis. There is also a Dunkin Donuts in the library, so that's pretty awesome :)"
