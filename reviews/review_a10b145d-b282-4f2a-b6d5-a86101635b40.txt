"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark University of Maryland is an school in its own league. Although it is not an ivy-league school it will definitely feel as such. The expectations of the school are very high and if you want to succeed you have to be committed to work hard. You will definitely have to pull all nighters, but it is not impossible. Apart from academics, University of Maryland is very diverse. There is something for everybody to do no matter who you are."
