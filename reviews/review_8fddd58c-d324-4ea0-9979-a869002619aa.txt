"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison It's a great school, there are always opportunities, but sometimes you have to actively seek them out. I enjoy the social life, but school is a bigger priority, which is the opinion of almost everyone I've met here. The dorms are decent, but some are really old. The food is okay, but it's nice that they are alway changing up the options."
