"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities It is a great public university set in an urban campus with lots of internship and job opportunities in the Minneapolis and St. Paul areas. On campus, there are lots activities going on constantly, ranging from clubs to intramural sports teams. Between the opportunities available on and off campus, the top rated academics, and the relatively cheaper price makes this a perfect university for anybody."
