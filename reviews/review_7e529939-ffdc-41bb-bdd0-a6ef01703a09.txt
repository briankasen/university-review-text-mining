"UniversityOfIowa Personally, I love the University of Iowa and I am very satisfied with my decision to attend school there. I feel as if my peers and I are all receiving a great education, while being able to balance that with a social life. So far my teachers and advisors have been realistic with me with my goals and very helpful in assisting me to find the correct path. I feel at home at the University of Iowa. My only critique to the school would be that I felt as if it took some time for me to feel at home at the school, and I know of other students who have felt the same way.  It seems to me that the school has a family-feel to it, and it just takes some time to actually feel like a part of the family. I do think the education is exceptional, however. I have always found it to be easy to get the help that I need on campus, and all of my advisors and professors have been extremely helpful and understanding. Overall, I believe the University of Iowa is a top-notch school, for any person."
