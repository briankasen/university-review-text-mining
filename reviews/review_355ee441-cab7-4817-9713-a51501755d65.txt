UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I love going to the University of Nebraska Lincoln. I am a very social person so going to a large college was good for me. There were lots of organizations to join and I did! I also made a lot of new friends through those organizations. If you are social and enjoy getting involved UNL is a great school for you!
