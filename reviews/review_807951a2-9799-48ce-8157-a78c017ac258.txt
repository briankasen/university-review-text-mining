"PurdueUniversity Purdue is a great campus. There is a great mix of good academics and recreation. The buildings are nice, and have a great aesthetic. Also the dorms have great spacing.   So to go further in depth Purdue is a great school for STEM majors and other majors also. The buildings around the school such as the aerospace building has a very modern aesthetic. To move on teachers a very smart and helpful, they have office hours that you can always go to, and you will receive the help you need. After that campus is beautiful over all especially when snow is on the ground. Next are the dorms they are placed variously around the school with some being closer to the school or some being a little farther. Most of them have air condition and good spacing, while a few others don't so there are many pros and cons so the decision is yours. Dining court food is pretty good but its dining court food so it gets old pretty fast, but there are multiple dining courts around the school. For example one has only healthy food or some just serve certain types of cuisines. Overall if you are looking for a beautiful, spacious, and intellectual campus Purdue is right for you"
