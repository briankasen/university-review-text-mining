"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a pretty decent school. I personally prefer smaller settings in order to learn more efficiently, and most of the classes are lecture halls or packed to the brim with students. There are tons of extracurricular activities on campus and I'm excited to check them out!"
