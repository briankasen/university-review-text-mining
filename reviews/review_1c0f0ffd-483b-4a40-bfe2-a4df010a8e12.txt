"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I come from a small town in rural Minnesota, and going to the University of Minnesota was the best decision I ever made. This school provides the diverse people and thinking that I have always wanted, and the amazing opportunities that are there has made these past three years the best of my life!"
