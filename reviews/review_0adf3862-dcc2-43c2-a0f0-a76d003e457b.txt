"OhioStateUniversity I have just completed my first year as a student at The Ohio State University and I honestly cannot imagine myself going anywhere else. It has a very diverse student body and their is an abundance of things to get involved in such as athletics, clubs, service and greek life. The academics and facilities are amazing and there is no shortage of opportunities for students to grow in and outside of the classroom. There are plenty of fun things to do on and around campus and in spite of being a large university their is a strong community environment."
