"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick As an incoming freshman to Rutgers University, I think it is a great, safe place to attend college. I recently went to my overnight orientation days and am even more excited for school to start. There are an abundance of activities, volunteer options, extra curriculars, and all different types of classes to take to expand and broaden your education ."
