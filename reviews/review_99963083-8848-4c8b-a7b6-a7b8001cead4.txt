"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick I was skeptical of Rutgers at first, my first major adjustment was the culture and people. Rutgers is a huge school and prides itself on diversity. However, depending on which school you attend and how involved on campus you are, you might fully experience this diversity or only get a small taste. Rutgers has definitely grown on me and I have met some amazing people, while also learning a lot inside and outside of the classroom. Stepping on campus might feel very overwhelming at first, but within a couple of months it definitely becomes a smaller community, in which there's so much to discover."
