"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick I had trouble adjusting to Rutgers University my first semester of my freshmen year. I was extremely unhappy and wanted out. But as I started to get less home sick and more involved. I began to love the school, realizing the professors and other faculty members really care about student academics and will make time to speak to you if needed. Also, the friends I have met kept my sane throughout exam weeks. Now that I am on summer vacation, I miss it. I can't wait to get back in the fall!"
