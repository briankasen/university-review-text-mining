"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor UofM has well-earned its high ranking name. The students are top of the line in academics. Unfortunately, this constant high praise gives many students a larger ego, making them forget their abilities to act humble. Ann Arbor is a beautiful city with endless resources, and students should feel more thankful for their good fortune and hard work paying off for them."
