UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I absolutely love the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I feel like everyday I have a new favorite college memory. I've met people from all over the world and had conversations about everything from the dining hall food to the existence of God. I appreciate all of the opportunities available to meet new people and try new things. There isn't enough room in this review to describe the pride I have to sit in the student section on Game Day! I love being a Husker and wouldn't change a thing!
