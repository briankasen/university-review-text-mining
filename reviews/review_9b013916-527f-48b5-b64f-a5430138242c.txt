"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick I think Rutgers New Brunswick is an exciting school with tons of opportunities for students to engage and be active in whatever interests them academically or extracurricularly. I like it a lot and would recommend it for anyone that's interested in going to a big school and all that big schools have to offer, but doesn't want to find themselves lost in a big sea. It's a huge school, but there are so many ways to get involved that it often feels a lot smaller than it really is."
