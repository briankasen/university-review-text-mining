"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is an amazing school to attend. It is home to the Husker football and volleyball teams, great teachers and academics, and students willing to put in the work to get things done. The campus is situated in downtown Lincoln, so there are multiple restaurants, stores, and businesses nearby for easy access to students. Most importantly it has a great atmosphere for an easy transition when starting college!"
