UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I loved being an undergraduate student at this institution. I consider this campus to be very involved and cares a lot about the students on campus. This institution is always striving to make that everyone on campus feels included. There is definitely something for everyone here and overall I believe it is a great institution academically and socially. Go Illini!
