"NorthwesternUniversity After 4 years spent on the beautiful north shore of Chicago, I couldn't rave more about Northwestern.  With a distinctly midwest feel (nice people), Evanston is a great college town 25 minutes by commuter train from downtown. With strong programs across the board and the opportunity to take classes in all department through the quarter system Northwestern mixes both academic and pre-professional pursuits in a unique blend. With one of the largest endowments in the nation, the facilities are state of the art with more improvements to come. Like any top university there will be academic pressure and the winters are undeniably cold but   I couldn't think of a better place to spend four years."
