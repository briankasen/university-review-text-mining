"OhioStateUniversity Social and academic success at Ohio State University-Main Campus is rooted in one's ability to find their communal niche, that is, to make the campus smaller. There are a number of clubs and student organizations, however, many of these clubs suffer the monotony of being less than stimulating. The creative student with regard to activity in the community is thus the successful student. After struggling for many semesters to find like-minded individuals within academic and extra-curricular student organizations: I was able to find my Ohio State family in the Ohio State Sailing Team. And so my advice is this: no matter the sport, join a club sports team. Club sport teams go beyond greek life and organization- you will travel together, make friends at other universities across the country, and you will all participate and develop a passion surrounding a common activity. I joined the team having no sailing experience and one year later I found myself on a catamaran sailing across the Atlantic ocean to the island of Bimini in the Bahamas with my teammates. During the summer I sail competitively with our team's faculty advisor and in August I will be in Croatia sailing in the Adriatic sea with teammates. Ohio State University is a large school but the best way to get involved and build a family is to join a club sport team- perhaps you may discover a new passion. Not only have I discovered the hobby of a lifetime, I have established a family and have made life-long friendships both at Ohio State University and across the country. The club sport community transcends state borders and competitors will be welcomed with open arms at schools across the country. If you are considering Ohio State University-Main Campus I vehemently encourage you to look into the club sport teams and to contact the current boards of interest. You will not regret it and you will be successful as a result."
