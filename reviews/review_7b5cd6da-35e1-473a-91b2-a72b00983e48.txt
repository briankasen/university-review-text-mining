"PurdueUniversity I loved going to Purdue and would have no problem making that decision again in life. I loved Greek Life and I thoroughly enjoyed Big 10 athletics. Campus has 30,000 undergrads but is very contained making life very walk-able and the bar scene is extremely fun and cheap. It was a great place to spend 4 years."
