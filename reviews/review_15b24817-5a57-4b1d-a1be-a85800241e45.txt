"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I love it! I have a great advisor that is of great help to me, especially when it's time to choose my classes for the next semester. The faculty is good and so are the dorms. Classes are okay; some are really hard, but most are neither too hard, nor too easy. As long as you study you'll be fine. Also, I've so many great people here. There is a lot of diversity and a lot of intelligent people at UIUC."
