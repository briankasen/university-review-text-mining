"UniversityOfIowa I believe that the University of Iowa is the best university for not only myself but many others. I think this because the academics are outstanding, the opportunities are endless, and the connections last a life time. I've met people who push me to do my best in and outside of the classroom. They help me be a well rounded student. The university has high expectations for me to meet as well. This school has made me push my limits to not just be satisfactory but to be something great. I love being in an environment that not only makes you feel like it is home, but is home."
