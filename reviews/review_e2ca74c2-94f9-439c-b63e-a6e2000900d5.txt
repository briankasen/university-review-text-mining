"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison Academics is amazing, and definitely makes me things about the world in different ways. One of the biggest problems with the school is that there is no meal plan, so students do waste a lot of money on food.  There are many ways to get involved by joiningâ€‹ organizations. It's almost impossible not to find an organization that doesn't fit you."
