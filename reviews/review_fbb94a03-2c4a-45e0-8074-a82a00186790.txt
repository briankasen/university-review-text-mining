"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Beautiful campus and very efficient design. Lots of resources to support students such as libraries with tutors that have a vast amount of expertise available and very helpful TA's in most courses. Some of the professors aren't as helpful or good at explaining the concepts of the course, but their are most professors are passionate about their courses and teaching, and the available help outside of class helps if the professor isn't the best at explaining things."
