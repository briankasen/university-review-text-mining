"OhioStateUniversity Going to the Columbus campus puts you in the heart of everything from food to entertainment. There are also a lot of internship opportunities depending on your major/area of focus. It is still a city, so you may still want to keep an eye out for the snakes and lock your doors. Despite that and the overwhelming size of campus, it is a great opportunity and they help prepare you for graduation and life afterward. There are also many more classes and options to take them available at the main Columbus Campus."
