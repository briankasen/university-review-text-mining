"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The tuition may be high, but it's well worth it for engineering and other STEM majors. The programs are catered to help students succeed, and there is help available all the time. The dorms are adequate and the food is the same. Overall, I think the University is amazing and great. I love it here!"
