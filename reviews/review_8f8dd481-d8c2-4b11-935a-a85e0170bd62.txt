"UniversityOfIowa I absolutely love going to the University of Iowa. During my time there, I have met so many amazing people and had countless incredible opportunities laid out before me. The academics are great, and there is a great night-life scene. The University of Iowa is really the best of all worlds that are considered when looking for a college/university. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else for school."
