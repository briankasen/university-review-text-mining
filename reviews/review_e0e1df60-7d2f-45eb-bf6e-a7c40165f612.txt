"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark I love the University of Maryland. It has so much diversity and I have been able to meet a bunch of different types of people. I learn something new every time I meet someone which is awesome. My professors are always super helpful when it comes to office hours, and meeting outside of the classroom which has helped me improve my grades throughout the years."
