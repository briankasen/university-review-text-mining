"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity PSU is a family school and I felt a lot of pressure to come. It has always been a good pressure though, never one that I feared and I was so excited to start touring. As soon as I walked on campus I felt at home. The housing staff is welcoming, they recognize your face and name, the teachers of smaller classes are always willing to go the extra mile, and the professors of large classes never make you feel as though you cannot talk to them. Sure it may be a bit of a party scene on the weekends, but there are plenty of other activities to partake in. I never feel alone here, and I know there are so many organizations I can join or resources I can take advantage of if I need to talk about my emotions."
