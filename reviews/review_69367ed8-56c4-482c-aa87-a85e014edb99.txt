"PurdueUniversity I absolutely love Purdue University, from the people to campus. I made many friends in my first semester, and I the professors were great and always available to talk to. Classes were challenging, and I am definitely learning new things each and every day. I have made amazing memories throughout my first semester of college, and I look forward to making more."
