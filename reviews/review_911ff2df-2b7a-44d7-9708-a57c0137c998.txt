"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison The UW is a great place for students who love to always be doing something, even just studying. There is a 24 hour library Monday-Thursday with select hours on Friday and Saturday which make it convenient when studying. Off-campus housing is also located almost directly on campus, which makes it easy to get to classes without too much commuting. As for drinking, it's also quite easy to not get involved if you choose to not do so. Don't be threatened by any rumors you hear of the school; you don't know what it's like until you get here."
