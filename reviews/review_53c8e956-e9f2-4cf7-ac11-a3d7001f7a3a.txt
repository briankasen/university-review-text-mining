"OhioStateUniversity Ohio State University-Main Campus is marvelous. The campus itself is absolutely beautiful and offers a safe environment. The academics are some of the best offered here. There is something to do for everyone around campus, and so many more options throughout Columbus. The housing is very comfortable. Football game day vibes around campus are indescribable-definitely one of my favorite things about being a buckeye. The other sports are super great here too. Nothing can beat the love and support the buckeyes have for this campus and other buckeyes. I would 10/10 recommend attending or at least thoroughly considering attending this campus."
