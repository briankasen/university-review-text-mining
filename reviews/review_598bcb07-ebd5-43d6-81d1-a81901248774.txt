"MichiganStateUniversity This is the best college I could have asked for. The on-campus housing is awesome, the dining hall food is amazing, but if you want the off -campus food that is also a great option. If you don't like to move around than this college is not for you because it is like a city, it's massive. In terms of the classes when you first arrive they will be big, but as you go deeper into your major they will get a lot smaller."
