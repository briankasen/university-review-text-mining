"PurdueUniversity Coming to Purdue has been one of the best experiences of my life. I can't imagine what it would be like at any another college. From starting my college experience off at Boiler Gold Rush meeting some of my closest friends to the extremely delicious dining halls conveniently located on residential campus, I wouldn't have it any other way. I absolutely love college more than I ever thought I would have. I finally get the chance to do what I want for myself and not what others want for me. I absolutely love the fact that I can finally attend sporting events and not have to either perform or have practice. Purdue is also one of the most diverse campuses and it really excites me learning about other people life stories and backgrounds. Also, the All-American Marching Band is so fun to watch during football games and I love their enthusiasm at all the sporting events. 10/10 would recommend to anyone even thinking about coming to Purdue! Boiler Up, Hammer Down and Hail Purdue!"
