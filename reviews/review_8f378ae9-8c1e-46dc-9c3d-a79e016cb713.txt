"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick The school is extremely diverse. It's the type of school where no one is going to baby you. If you want something you need to go get it yourself. I personally think all colleges are too expensive, Rutgers being fairly average in tuition. Rutgers might be a little overwhelming, but it's a great place to transition into the ""adult world""."
