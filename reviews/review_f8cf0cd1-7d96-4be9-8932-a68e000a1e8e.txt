UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I think the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign is a good and very well rounded university. However I feel very unsafe there at night. There are many crimes that occur regularly and walking alone at night is very frightening. I feel as if the overall environment and safety needs to be improved.
