"UniversityOfIowa Attending the University of Iowa has been an incredible experience. I was weary of attending a college near to my current residence, but the campus environment, friendly professors, and variety of opportunities has provided me with the full ""college experience"" despite my proximity to home. I am grateful for all of the possibilities provided by the school, and cannot wait to spend the next 3 and a half years here!"
