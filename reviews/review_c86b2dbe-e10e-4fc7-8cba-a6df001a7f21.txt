"NorthwesternUniversity I absolutely love Northwestern. Any school has its positive and negative aspects, but Northwestern's positive characteristics drastically outweigh its negative characteristics. I have witnessed immense personal growth in myself emotionally, mentally, and of course, academically since coming to Northwestern. I am so grateful for the friends I have made, the conversations I've been a part of, and the opportunities that are available to me. I am thankful that I can say the words ""once a wildcat, always a wildcat."""
