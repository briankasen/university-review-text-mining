MichiganStateUniversity A wonderful experience for my daughter. Lots of learning/growth opportunities outside of the classroom. There are some fantastic faculty and staff. There was a problem in the computer system when she applied for graduation. MSU Registrar Dr. Nicole Rovig and her staff responded quickly and worked with my daughter's advisor to clear up the issue so she could graduate on time.  Great service!
