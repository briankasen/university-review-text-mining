"IndianaUniversityBloomington Overall, I think Indiana University-Bloomington is a fantastic school. My favorite aspect of this school is how to students are not afraid to voice their opinions. Whether it be changes that need to be made to this country or this campus, the students always gather to protest. Additionally, there is always something to do on campus and around campus. Every culture is represented here by student led organizations or the diverse restaurants here."
