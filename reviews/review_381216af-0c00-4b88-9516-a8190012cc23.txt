"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The food at the diner is absolute garbage. The school's President doesn't seem to care about some social issues, but many students and student groups do. On-campus housing is a crap shoot and off-campus housing is a ripoff. They look great on paper-- strong research and athletics, abundant opportunities for networking and career-building. Mental health resources are sometimes inadequate. A Nazi sympathizer murdered someone with a knife last summer. Close to DC, but far enough away that commuting is a hassle. White supremacist groups aren't sanctioned by the school, but they distribute flyers anyway. Dominant, intrusive Christian presence on campus, although there's also a    well-known Hillel."
