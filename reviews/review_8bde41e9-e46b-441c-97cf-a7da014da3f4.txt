"NorthwesternUniversity I have had the pleasure of spending two incredible academic years as a students at Northwestern University--and I am beyond pumped to continue my education here for two more years until I graduate in June 2019.  Northwestern University is a highly competitive, demanding, and intense place of study, but the opportunities provided by attending such a prestigious university are priceless and incredibly valuable."
