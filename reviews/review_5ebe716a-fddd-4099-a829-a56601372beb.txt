"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln It is a very nice school. I have enjoyed being on campus. There are so many activities to join that it is not hard to meet new people and find new friends to talk to. The academics are very well organized. There are many different places to go to talk and get help from people in your degree. The school is very nice and even though it has a lot of people, the school is very oriented around the students."
