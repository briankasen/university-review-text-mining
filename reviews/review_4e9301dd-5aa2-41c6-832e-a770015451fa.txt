"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Overall, the U is a great university.  I have enjoyed attending a larger university that offers a wide variety of activities.  I have found interesting clubs in my major, sporting clubs and have even started a club while I was there.  Even though there is lots to offer, the campus doesn't feel like a large university.  The class sizes are reasonable and the professors are available to discuss things outside of class.  If I had the chance to re-choose colleges I would choose the University of Minnesota again."
