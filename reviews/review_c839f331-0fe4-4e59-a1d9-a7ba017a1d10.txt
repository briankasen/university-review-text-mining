RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick The University is huge. I can only speak about Mason Gross School of Performing Arts. Their brass department is top notch. I don't need to go to the other campuses much. Everything is right on my campus. But if I do want to go to the other campuses the bus system is free and great.
