PurdueUniversity I am a 3rd generation Boiler! I was born to be here.  The campus is outstanding.  The professors are cool and interested in your success.  There's a lot of diversity at Purdue.  There is always something to do besides studying all the time!  The best part....I'm getting a great education at the world's best university!   Love it here!  Boiler Up!
