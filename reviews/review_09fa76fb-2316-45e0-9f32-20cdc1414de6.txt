"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark I love being here! UMD is such a great school - it's huge, there's so many different extracurricular and academic opportunities, there's classes that appeal to any type of interests, and the people are friendly. The campus is beautiful, and even though it's a big place there's so many different things going on all at once that you can find your niche no problem. I'm in the Honors College and I'm surrounded by like-minded people, and have made so many new friends here. I'm so happy I decided to come here, and it's close to home so I can do my laundry and get home-cooked meals regularly."
