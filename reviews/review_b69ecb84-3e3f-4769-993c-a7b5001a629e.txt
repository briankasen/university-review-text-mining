"UniversityOfIowa I loved the opportunities Iowa has provided me in my first year. Through Iowa Fraternity and Sorority Life, I have attended multiple leadership retreats and conferences. Through Medicus, I visited the University of Minnesota's Medical School. However, the university has a serious alcohol problem. There have been multiple deaths on campus and the RA's do not care to keep control of the drugs or alcohol in the rooms of freshman. This is without a doubt a party school, but if you keep your nose clean, many opportunities will be open to you."
