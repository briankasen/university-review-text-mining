"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I love the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is my second home, it has introduced me to some of the most amazing people and it fosters individuality and intellectual success. Classes are challenging but not impossible, and there is always something to do, whether that be on a week night or a week-end. I could not be more happy with my choice of school."
