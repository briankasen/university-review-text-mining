"NorthwesternUniversity From the outside, it might seem like Northwestern is full of nerds.  However, the community is actually very vibrant.  It's true that we all care about doing well here, but many student's passions lay outside the academic sphere.  Once you start to get to know people here, you'll find that most students have a lot more to talk about than just their schoolwork.  As for other stereotypes, Greek life is prominent on campus, but not overwhelming. When it comes to partying, I some have friends who go out every weekend(and several weekdays), and other friends who never go out.  It's impossible to describe all Northwestern students with one label(except, you know, Northwestern students) because we come from so many different backgrounds and have such different dreams."
