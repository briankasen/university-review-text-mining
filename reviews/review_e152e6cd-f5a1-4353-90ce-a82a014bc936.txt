RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers New Brunswick has a lot of available opportunities for students. A great school to attend. I actually transferred from Syracuse University to Rutgers. Going to Rutgers feels like home. I love Rutgers and I am so lucky I transferred and got the chance to learn here.
