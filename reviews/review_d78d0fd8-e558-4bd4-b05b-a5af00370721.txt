"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick I think there are some great parts and some parts that need work. The offices take forever to get things done, however if you are all set the programs, clubs and events are really nice. There is a great variety of classes to attend and the campuses and surrounding areas are pretty nice.  There are some shady parts, just pay attention and use the night mover if you need it. I wish the school would stop spending so much on football though, it seems a waste when the games often end badly for Rutgers, and won games cause surprise."
