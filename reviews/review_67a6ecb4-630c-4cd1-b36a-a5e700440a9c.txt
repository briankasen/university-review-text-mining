"OhioStateUniversity OSU is a great school because it has something for everybody. There are so may activities to get involved in and it gives many people a purpose. The courses are challenging and the faculty expect hard work from students. There are so many clubs that fit different interests and the people there are amazing. OSU is great for students who are really social and students who are more introverted because it is so big. My experience there so far has been challenging, but incredible. The things I do there have meaning and it is really amazing to see such a variety of people when it comes to interests, culture, majors, etc... OSU is really an incredible school. Go Bucks!"
