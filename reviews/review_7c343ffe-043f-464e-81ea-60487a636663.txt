"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The University of Illinois in Champaign is a very competitive school so don't expect to be able to slack off, but it is not impossible to get good grades. The professors and teaching assistants that I have had do their best to make themselves available to students. There are clubs and groups for almost every interest someone could have, from political groups to equestrian clubs. Campus is relatively safe and there is almost always someone on the quad. Buses go almost everywhere, from on campus to into Champaign town. Overall, this school provides an exciting and fulfilling learning environment. There are a great deal of opportunities in this college."
