"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign UIUC is a great school with an amazing atmosphere. The campus is very chill and laid back. Everyone is on the grind and just as we study hard we party hard...because we earn it! Classes are very hard, you do teach yourself, and thank goodness for TA office hours! the physics department is not good but every other department and college is! Love my school!"
