"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan is very beautiful from the inside of buildings and from the outsides. The people here like to partake in campus activities a lot and are often very involved in political causes-but only small sects of people. The one bad thing I see at the campus is people pushing their religious beliefs to others in heavy traffic areas such as the ""Diag""(which is the main block of the University) and in the areas surrounding it. The class sizes for some classes are certainly huge, but they always have supplementary aids for those who need it. The teachers are also very helpful and always stay later than they need to if their are students with loads of questions-which there always are-and certainly encourage students to learn more. There is some underlying tension of race and ethnicity that other people have felt here, but I have not so I cannot fully comment on this matter. Overall, for me the University of Michigan is one of my favorite places because of the amazing dorms, amazing food(they even have a halal station) and the encouraging professors."
