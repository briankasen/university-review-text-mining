"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Penn State is definitely a very active and fun learning environment. Everywhere you look there is always something to do and people to talk to. Even though it is filled with alot of activities you can still get alot of things done and the facilities work for everyone very well. Although it is great, sometimes Penn State neglect the mental issues that happens in their school."
