"UniversityOfIowa The University of Iowa is a great place to be. I knew I wanted to come here by my sophomore year of high school because of their number one ranking speech pathology program. I can always find a sporting event to go to, a concert or recital at the music building to attend to, and many more extra curricular activities that encourage involvement and leadership across campus."
