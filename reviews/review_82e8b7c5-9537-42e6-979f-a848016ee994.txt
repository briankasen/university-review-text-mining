"PurdueUniversity Purdue holds high standards for its students -- one can easily assume that every student that attends this top university is more than competent in their respective fields. While this school is mainly known for its heavy STEM focus, that does not mean that any other discipline of study is lacking. A degree from Purdue -- no matter what it is -- will get future graduates extremely far in whatever career they wish to pursue. Overall, even though I have only spent 1 semester here, I just know that by the end of my college career I will truly have felt that I have earned my degree through hard work and determination."
