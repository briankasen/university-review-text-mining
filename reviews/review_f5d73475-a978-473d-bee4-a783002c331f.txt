UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I love the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I think it has challenging programs and it welcome to every student that is admitted. There are plenty of places to go and people to meet. Everyone has an interesting story to tell and the professors are well versed in their studies and always helpful to talk to. The only thing I would fix is adding a escalator to Bascom Hill because it is quite a walk.
