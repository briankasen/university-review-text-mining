"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison The University of Wisconsin is a very great school that provides many different opportunities for a variety of different people. There are many different extracurriculars, jobs, research opportunities and great facilities for everyone which makes the campus great. My only dislike about the school is how large the campus and class sizes are. It makes it hard to get to know your professor and your classmates."
