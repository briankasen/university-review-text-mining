"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor Whether you're from a small town or a big city, the University of Michigan becomes home very quickly. Even within such a large community, you can find your niche and still be part of multiple groups. Joining Michigan means joining one of the largest research communities in the world & building connections that help you every step of the way. While there is not a significant amount of socioeconomic or racial diversity, the campus is politically and socially active, so you can definitely find a cause to support with like-minded peers.  As with any school, not every professor is a favorite, but in order to make connections and stand out in such a huge place, it is critical to become familiar with your professors, even those in your freshman-level courses filled with hundreds of students.  Greek life is a big deal on campus, but it is not necessary to join it to make great friends! Sports is also a big deal (especially football and basketball), but you can still show school spirit even if you don't attend sporting events! The entire town is dedicated to the sense of being a college town, and there's always good and new food to discover."
