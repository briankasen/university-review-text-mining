"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I think overall UW Madison is a great place for students.  While there can be some issues with being open minded and accepting of all, I think most students put forth an effort to expand their knowledge and here various sides of any situation. Badgers are great at balancing putting a lot of work into their academics and having a good time. We really live by the saying ""work hard, play hard."""
