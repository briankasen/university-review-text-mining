"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a strong sense of academic priority and I feel that I am supported academically and personally through the resources that the university provides. I feel as though the safety of the students on this campus could be better, by extending safe rides borders to take students to where they live. Overall, the University of Illinois is a great school that I am a proud to be part of."
