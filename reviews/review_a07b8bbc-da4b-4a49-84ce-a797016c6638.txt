UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I love UW-Madison! Not only does the school offer exceptional academics but also many opportunities outside of academics! I enjoy my classes and have had excellent professors! I am  involved in a club and fraternity and have had great experiences so far! I also attend sports events and have fun on the weekends! The school offers a great balance of academics and extracurricular activities!
