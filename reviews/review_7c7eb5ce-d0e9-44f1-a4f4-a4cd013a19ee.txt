"PurdueUniversity If you are certain about your field of study (or you're parents are not giving you an option about your major) this school is meant for you. The majors here are very specific, and to someone who doesn't know what they want to do, it may overwhelming. Purdue is known for its polytech, engineering school, and school of agriculture. As a student fro Purdue's Polytechnic, I feel confident about what I have learned thus far. The professors here are excellent, there are always student hours that are available, and they are willing to adjust their schedule to help you.  West Lafayette/ Lafayette (Purdue's location) is very quiet, in fact some may call it boring(I personally think its quirky, but can get boring at times). The weird weather changes tend make me and others ill, and the winters sometimes discourage me to want to go class at 7:00 am. There isn't much to do unless you are enrolled in a club or are part of a sorority/ fraternity. The people here are generally friendly, and if you choose to pursue intellectual conversation it can be found.The campus has so many international students that it gives you a great opportunity to interact with people who have different viewpoints and beliefs ( I recommend that you talk with someone who is not from the U.S, some of the conversations can be mind opening). Overall, I think its a good school, and I would not trade what I have learned or experienced here for something else."
