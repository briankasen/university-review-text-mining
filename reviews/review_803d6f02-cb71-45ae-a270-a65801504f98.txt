"OhioStateUniversity Like most kids, I wanted to get away from my family and go out-of-state for school. I wanted to spread my wings and fly far, far away and escape the boring landscape of Columbus, Ohio. Being raised here, I thought I saw everything Columbus had to offer. Easton Mall on Morse Road, Polaris Mall and the McDonald's by my apartment, I knew it all! I was bored and I needed some new scenery... but I'm glad I didn't. Ohio State is a place where I can live, laugh and learn. I feel like I am so more aware of myself and the world around me ever since coming here. Ohio State is like its own little town, with its own food places, clothing, diversity and so much more. If you like reading, there's great libraries. If you like parties, pretty sure you can find one easily. If you need help in that stup- I mean challenging chemistry class, you can get tutoring.  You gained a few pounds over the semester and you're ready to lose it, there are gyms like RPAC there for you. If you like extracurriculars, OSU has hundreds. OSU is the place to be if you're ready to have the time of your life. Personally, I can't wait to continue to grow while going to school here. With great research opportunities, faculty, people and more I am glad to call OSU my home."
