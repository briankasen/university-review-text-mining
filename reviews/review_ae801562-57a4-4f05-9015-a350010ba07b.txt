"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln UNL is a nice college to attend. There are tons of activities and festivities that go on throughout the year. However, there is  a lot of racism on campus and the university is money hungry. They increase everything on campus but instead of putting extra money towards kids in financial need they SPOIL the athletes and build unnecessary thing all over campus to make it look pleasing to the public eye. If they would focus on the important things then maybe they wouldn't lose so many students."
