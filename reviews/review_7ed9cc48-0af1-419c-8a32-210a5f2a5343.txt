"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Even though Rutgers isn't a perfect place and I have grievances with certain things (like RUDOTS or occasionally lack-luster dining hall food), there would be things to complain about at any school, and overall, I've been exposed to so many amazing people, opportunities, and experiences that I would not give up for the world.  Personally, the Livingston Theatre Company and the students that I have met there were what really won me over; they helped me to clearly determine what path I wanted to take in my life and decide on my major, and I would not have gotten the experiences and connections I have now anywhere else.  Not only that, but it's also a competitive school with excellent academics, they offer almost every major under the sun, and the busses aren't as bad as everyone says they always are."
