"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan- Ann Arbor is a beautiful campus. Not only that but the classes are interesting and stretch the students perspective to include all. This school leaves a mark on you and is great for making connections all over the world. While academic life is rigorous, extra-curriculars and social events are plentiful each night. My one criticism is you can get lost in the crowd if you don't put yourself out there! Overall, a wonderful school and wonderful place to be! Forever Go Blue!"
