"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor U of M is an amazing university. The academic and social balance is perfect - we are in all the top rankings and we have a great atmosphere. Classes are challenging, but we have plenty of stress relief with football at the Big House and the lively atmosphere of Ann Arbor. Our engineering facilities (specially Mechanical Engineering) are state of the art and student-focused. There are plenty of great study spots on campus. Professors care about teaching and are almost always available and willing to help you. Overall, I've enjoyed the past four years here very much. Go Blue!"
