"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark In general, I love UMD because it's all about studying, sports, and being green and inclusive. The atmosphere is nice most of the time, everyone is enthusiastic in terms of studying and activities. The faculties and professors I know are all really nice. The only thing I'm not loving is the on-campus housing and dining plans, they are somehow expensive and some of the residents hall don't even have ACs."
