"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I'm a freshman this year and I really enjoy this campus. The people are very friendly and encourage diversity. The teachers are interesting and very good. Sports (GO HUSKERS!) are very important to the UNL students. Overall, the campus is very social and a great place to be."
