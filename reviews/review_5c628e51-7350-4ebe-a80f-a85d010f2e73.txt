"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln Lincoln is a great place with plenty of opportunities provided by both the university and the community. There is a sense of togetherness in the community that has been cultivated by decades of sportsmanship, growth, and kindness.  There are excellent programs for almost every field of study. Nebraska is a fantastic place, and I would advise anyone considering UNL to count its location in the ""pros"" category rather than the ""cons."""
