"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison Everything you have heard about the University of Wisconsin-Madison is false besides the fact that it is truly amazing.  I have experienced first-hand that professors do care about their students even in huge lecture halls, half of my classes as a first year student are less than 30 people, and it is extremely easy to get from place to place on campus.  There is always something to do, which gives non-drinkers plenty of activities to participate in on weekends.  It has already been better than I ever expected, and I have three more years left."
