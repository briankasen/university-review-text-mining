"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity I believe it is a resourceful university. I learned a lot during my tenure here. However, it would be very helpful if there were more diverse faculty members. That way, students of all backgrounds may be able to relate with them. I experience a lot of difficulties with the staff that are predominant on campus because it seems as though they favor one group than the other. So scheduling appointments, asking for advice, not being granted certain opportunities that another group would,  are some of the difficulties the minorities  undergo. Other that, it is an amazing university with lots to offer. One just have to work hard in receiving these opportunities."
