"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I have loved my experience here at UWM so far. As a student interested in continuing my studies with Chinese, I was super excited that I was able to study fashion design at the same time. My academic adviser is super supportive and is always giving me good feedback to ensure that I stay on track for schooling . There is always something going on on campus, so it's good to plan out which things I want to go to in my scheduler.  The sports culture is amazing, and we've got mad love for football. Overall I love it here, it's not as diverse as most college campuses (considering the fact that it is a PWI) but the multicultural and minority communities are tightly knit and still make a way for students and diversity to intertwine. I love my school, and it's honestly the best choice I made in my life. College is a time for us to grow and mold into the adults we wish to be, and picking the right place for your education, the place where you will be living for the next few years, is a big part of it. #gobadgers"
