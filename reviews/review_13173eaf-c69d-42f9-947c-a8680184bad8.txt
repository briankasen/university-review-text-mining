"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity I like it a lot and would never leave or think about going elsewhere, but there are definitely some improvements that could be made.  Academically, the school is great but the classes tend to be very large, especially you freshman year. It can be overwhelming. My favorite thing about Penn State is how many different things you can get involved in like THON organizations, clubs in your major, and even workout groups like CHAARG"
