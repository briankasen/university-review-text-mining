"MichiganStateUniversity Overall, my experience in Michigan State University has been phenomenal. I am in the Lyman Briggs Program and the education I get here is by far the best in Michigan. This program leans towards students who wish to deal with medicine for their career so it really helps me as I aspire to become an Orthopedic Surgeon. I made a great decision by coming to Michigan State University and I hope my entire college experience is like this."
