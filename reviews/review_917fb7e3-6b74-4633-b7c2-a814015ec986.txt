"OhioStateUniversity I think OSU is as ideal as it gets. Advisors are here to help, professors care about their students, if there is something you're interested in there is a club for it, and the surrounding area is lively and exciting. If I could go back, I will still pick OSU every time. The vibe is welcoming and I have never felt out of place."
