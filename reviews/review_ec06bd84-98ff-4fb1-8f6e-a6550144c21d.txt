"NorthwesternUniversity We did a campus tour.  60% of the students go for free, so if you have any money you are paying an exorbitant tuition to subsidize someone else.  Available classes include jokes like Marriage 101.  Apparently the students can study graffiti and actually get credit for it.  Totally unimpressive tour guides unlike other schools (Duke, IL, Wash U) who had personable and articulate types.  NU has sunk the ""liberal arts"" philosophy to new lows."
