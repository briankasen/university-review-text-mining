"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark Before I came to the University of Maryland, I was overwhelmed by the vastness of the college and I was worried that I would be lost in the sea that is this college's environment. But after nearly a semester here, I am happy to admit that I had been worried for nothing. Besides my first day I have not struggled to find my classes and all my professors in those classes really care about what they are teaching and are always willing to help you in class and outside class. My biggest fear of college was that I would not like living on my own in this new environment, but I have yet to feel homesick and that is due entirely on how welcoming it feels here. Just wish the food was better but the shops around campus are fantastic."
