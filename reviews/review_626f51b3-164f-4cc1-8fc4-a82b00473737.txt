UniversityOfIowa I love going to school here and being apart of the community. When I go home I just want to be back on campus with my friends. I've made so many here but overall the school is great. My classes are all pretty good but you definitely need to study and stay onto of your work. It is okay to skip a class every once and while but do not skip all the time.
