"NorthwesternUniversity My favorite campus tradition is painting the rock.  We have a giant rock on campus that students choose to guard and paint in order to advertise for their events.  The tradition behind it is that you, as a group, have to guard the rock for 24 hours and then, under the cover of darkness, paint the rock over with your message or event information.  
Before I graduate, one of my goals is to guard the rock for a total of 100 hours.  Starting my junior year, I've painted it 6 times and put in 36 hours at the rock."
