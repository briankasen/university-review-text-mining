"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The campus is the best in the Big 10! So much to see and do...and learn! No matter who you are you will find a place where you fit in and will make memories to last a lifetime.  People often steer away from big school. Don't steer away from the U! Choosing to go to the U has granted me several opportunities, including: researching with top people in their chosen fields, learning judo, volunteer for several non profits, and making friends with all kinds of people. I'm not the only one either! From my time here, everyone I've spoken to has had lists of reasons why they love going here. The Gopher Spirit is very much alive for a reason!"
