"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor In my opinion, this school is way too big to meet a good group of people. It seems like this place is dominated by wealthy students who don't have any regard for the cost of the school. It also seems like a vast majority of people here are not interested in actually learning, but rather they are interested in coming to school to party and walk away with a degree, not an actual education."
