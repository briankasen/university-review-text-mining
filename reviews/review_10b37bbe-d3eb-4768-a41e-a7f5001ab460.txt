"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers University provides a phenomenal educational experience that is truly unparalleled. As a philosophy major, I was able to learn from internationally venerated academics whose contributions to the field were nothing less than staggering. Both the students and the professors are invested in scholarship and in preserving collegial integrity. The class sizes are relatively small, and the lectures are nonpareil. I cannot praise this university enough for all it has accomplished. That being said, I wholeheartedly recommend this Rutgers University to any serious, academically minded student."
