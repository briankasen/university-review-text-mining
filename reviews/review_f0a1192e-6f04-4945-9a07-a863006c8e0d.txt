UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I transfered here from community college and I love it. I commute and its also not to bad of a drive. I am able to get the resources I need to succeed and also many people are extremely friendly in class and on campus. The deans are also very helpful when it comes to figuring out what to do for majors and classes.
