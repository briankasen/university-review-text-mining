"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is uniquely different from a majority of large public universities. It offers a small, rural community with urban amenities. The student population is largely from Illinois, especially the Chicago area. However, there are large amounts of international students. The options for extracurriculars are endless, the social scene is always active, and the academic opportunities will set you apart from a majority of college graduates."
