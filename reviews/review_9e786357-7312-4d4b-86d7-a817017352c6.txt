There are always ways to get involved around campus because there are tons of organizations and clubs that people can join from a BBQ club, to dancing, to Greek life, to even something for your major! You name it and we have something that you are interested in. Ohio state is the place to be because you can always get connected and experience life changing events all around. There are multiple ways to get connected around campus from the students, to professors and even alumni. We all treat each other like family because we are all here to learn, grow, and prosper in our field of work. I've always wanted to be a Buckeye because it will always live with me! From the academics, to the sports, events around campus and overall atmosphere you will never be disappointed when you come to campus. There is always someone here to help you and guide you in the direction that you are trying to go for your life.
