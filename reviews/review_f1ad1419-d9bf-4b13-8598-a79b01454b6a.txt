UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a beautiful university with a great staff. There are so ways to get involved and be an active Husker. I've enjoyed all of the groups that the university provides for its students. There is definitely a place for EVERYONE at UNL. I can't wait for three more years! GO BIG RED
