"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick I believe that Rutgers University is a very good university for opportunities. There are a wide variety of courses which students can take to explore possible paths, and there is also an equally diverse array of clubs and organizations that provide students with access to different resources in networking and funding. In addition, the overall student body is very energetic, they can often be found supporting their team at the football games or going out for fun nights on the weekends.  The campus is active from morning to night, but it is safe everywhere. I would recommend this school to anyone looking for a space to explore options."
