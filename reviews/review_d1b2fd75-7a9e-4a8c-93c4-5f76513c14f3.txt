"NorthwesternUniversity Throw away those purple overalls. Do not let your parents drive you to college in Uncle Frank’s school bus, even if it has enough room for all your stuff. On the first day of class, do not tell that joke about the dog and the umbrella. I know, I know, it’s hilarious, but I’m telling you, people just do not get it. Sit on the left towards the front in lecture hall—that way you have a good view, but you don’t look like you’re trying too hard. Make sure to get the bunk farthest from the door so that if a kidnapper comes in the middle of the night you’re not the one he takes. It is not possible to memorize a semester’s worth of material the night before an exam. Student loans do not equal free money. Do not make glittery posters for the soccer captain—even if you do have a crush on him. Guard your quarters with your life, because come laundry day, they are worth a whole lot more than twenty-five cents. 
Lastly, forget everything you just read. Relax. Be yourself."
