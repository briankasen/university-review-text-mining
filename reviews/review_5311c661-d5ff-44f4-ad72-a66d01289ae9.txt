UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor University of Michigan is the best public university in this country. The University has strong academics especially since the average ACT score for newly admitted students is 28. The University has over 1000 student organizations so there is no excuse not to get involved. The University has a great athletic program because this year Michigan was Big Ten Basketball champions and our football teams record was 10 wins-3 losses. U of M has just about every major you could think of and many students are double majors. I think the Financial Aid office could do better in helping middle class families pay for tuition and room and board but other than that University of Michigan is great place for higher education.
