"IndianaUniversityBloomington I grew up on this campus and there is no place that I would rather be. The environment at IU is so specific, you can't get it anywhere else. With it's beautiful wooded campus, lots of great people to talk to and learn about, people from around the world; IU is the place to learn about yourself and others!"
