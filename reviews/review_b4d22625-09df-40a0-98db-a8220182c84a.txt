"OhioStateUniversity I am currently a freshmen at OSU and have been struggling with getting into the groove of college life. I live in a single dorm so I don't have a roommate. Having chosen the single dorm, I can say that is probably my biggest regret. It has been really hard for me to make friends and haven't connected with anyone on my floor. Even though I haven't made any new friends, the campus itself is what allows me to enjoy my time at OSU. The dining halls are great and the libraries are beautiful. I enjoy going out on the Oval and lay out a blanket and read and study there. Although the people may not be the best, the campus sure makes up for it."
