"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I am a current first year student here at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and overall I really love the vibe that I get everyday here at the University.  The social scene is really inviting and there is something for everybody from all walks of life. Everyone for the most part is very welcoming and excited for the overwhelming opportunities. The academics are the best on a public school scale in the midwest, and overall UW Madison is a great institution!"
