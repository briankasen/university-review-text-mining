"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor I love this school. It is exactly what I needed out of an undergraduate education. We have an incredibly diverse campus in terms of interests and backgrounds, and I believe that anyone who attends this university will find a home here. That being said, Michigan is known for being a school that ""works hard, and plays harder,"" so if you're not careful, the fast-moving current of the campus culture can become overwhelming."
