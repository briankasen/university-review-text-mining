UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities My first semester at the U of M- Twin Cities was very exceptional but also had its occasional dreadful moments. U of M has a lot of opportunities in many different fields and areas where I was able to enrich my knowledge in the medical field and beyond. U of M is such a color full campus. One will never be bored on campus. There is always stuff to do and activities to take part in and if not anything else we have enough home work to keep the boredom away. Even though finals are hard and classes are hard but if your teachers classes become easier. At U of M one will never have a dull moment.
