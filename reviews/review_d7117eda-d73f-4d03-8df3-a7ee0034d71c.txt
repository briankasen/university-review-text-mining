"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark I think the University of Maryland is home to many different types of people. You can find your niche and make your friend group as small as you want, or you can branch out! There is always a party or an event on campus, but there is absolutely no pressure to go and participate in anything you do not want to do. In addition, there are so many clubs and so many classes to choose from. This school really allows you to become who you want to become and pursue interests without feeling embarrassed or held back."
