"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick It is a big school , but it also means that there is always something to do. Although it feels big at first, you find the people you get along with and when you join organizations, it feels smaller. Although it is a state school, the courses are still rigorous and you will learn something. Stay organized and use time management and things will go well."
