"OhioStateUniversity OSU is an incredibly expansive university that has opportunities for many. At times, the amount of privilege on this campus is apparent, but there are also students that have been offered opportunities from the school to be able to pursue higher education. Which is great, but personally I feel that OSU can do more to help students in need. Academics are steadily becoming more important, but this depends on each department. There is surprisingly a large portion of students on the campus that don't take their education seriously. I have a love-hate relationship with OSU, but overall, I'm happy that I've chosen this school because of the people I've met, the opportunity to engage with different majors, and the city of Columbus."
