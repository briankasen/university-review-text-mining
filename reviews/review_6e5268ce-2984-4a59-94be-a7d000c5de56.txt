"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign It's a huge school and it's great for all types of people. For outgoing people, some bars near campus let you in even if you're 18 and if you are an academia, the engineering and accounting courses are great here. Also, Greek life is huge here and about a quarter of the student body is either in a sorority of a fraternity. So if you are looking for the perfect college experience, UIUC would be your best choice!"
