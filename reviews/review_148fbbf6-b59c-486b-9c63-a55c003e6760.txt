PurdueUniversity Purdue is consistently ranked as a top school. It is currently the number 4 public university. The academics are rigorous leading to a highly respected degree. The social scene is the worst of Big Ten schools and the football program is terrible too. Basketball is fun if you are into it. The school is widely diverse. International students like to stay in a clique and don't really participate in the rest of campus which is unfortunate. The campus is pretty and definitely safe. I'm proud to be a Boilermaker.
