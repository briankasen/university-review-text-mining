"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick As a school to school transfer, Rutgers New Brunswick is mostly new to me. I grew up in close proximity to the campus but I only recently discovered what its like. This campus has forced me out of my shell this summer. From the night life to the campus and online resources, there are many opportunities available! The size of the campus has been intimidating but once the semester starts I'm sure I will adjust easily."
