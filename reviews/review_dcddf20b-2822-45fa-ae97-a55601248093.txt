"MichiganStateUniversity Overall, MSU is a great school to attend. There are plenty of parties or school activities to participate in throughout the entire school year. It's really easy to get into contact with your professor or TA or even someone to help you make decisions with academic or financial decisions. MSU makes sure you can succeed academically all while having the most enriching and exciting four years of your life."
