IndianaUniversityBloomington Indiana University is a great school with excellent academics in almost every major field of study. The Kelley School of Business is the #1 ranked public business school and many other schools within IUB are nationally ranked. Bloomington itself is a thriving community with something for everyone. Kirkwood has an amazing bar scene and 4th street has just about every type of ethnic food you could ever want. I knew as soon as I stepped on the beautiful campus that this was the school for me and I would recommend it to anyone I know.
