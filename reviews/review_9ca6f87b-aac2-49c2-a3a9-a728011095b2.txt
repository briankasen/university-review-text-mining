"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a great school, with many opportunities to get involved around campus. Being a first year student, I found it really easy to get to know the campus and all of the resources that were available to me. Most professors have posted office hours, which makes it very easy to get the help I need when I need it. Even when you cannot get into your professors office hours, there's a resource center for most subjects, where you can get the help you need from graduate students. There's a lot of resources when it comes to getting help on a certain area of a subject, which I find really beneficial. There are many activities and events going on around campus so there is never a boring moment. With so many clubs to chose from, finding something to do and meeting knew people is very easy. I would definitely recommend the University of Nebraska-Lincoln!"
