PurdueUniversity I absolutely love Purdue. It is the perfect mix of focused academics and fun weekends. Going Greek was a great decision since it is such a huge part of the campus culture. There is always stuff to do around campus and a ton of ways to get involved. It makes a Big 10 university feel like a home. Not to mention it is a very affordable university that has maintained tuition prices for years.
