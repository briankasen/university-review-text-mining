"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign When I am on campus, I feel like I am somewhere where I truly belong! The academics are great and I love the College of Engineering and ACES.  ACES finds a way to personalize the college experience for all the students in the department even though the UIUC campus is so big. I am so excited to study at UIUC for the next four years!"
