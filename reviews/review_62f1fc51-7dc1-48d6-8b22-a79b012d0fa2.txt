"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities has a beautiful campus with equally impressive students and faculty. The atmosphere is extremely friendly and the opportunities are endless. Although the campus is large, there are many different ways people can make it around the campus. I am more than excited to be attending this school in the fall."
