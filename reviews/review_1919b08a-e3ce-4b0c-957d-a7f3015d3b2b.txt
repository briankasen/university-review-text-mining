"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick I really enjoy attending Rutgers, it is a great state school that is affordable and well recognized globally. The academics are very high end with great facilities and teachers. The school is located in New Brunswick which is not the safest location but the college campus feels safe and well maintained and patrolled by campus police. I am happy with my choice of university."
