"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan is committed to excellence, no matter what. Here, there are resources available to make yourself the greatest you can be, but people will not hand the opportunities to you. In Ann Arbor, people work hard for every opportunity they receive, and your success is the fruit of your labor. Even though the classes are hard, we are pushed to do our best by our professors and we are encouraged to live a balanced life too. Overall, the University of Michigan is a place you have to work hard to succeed at, but you are given the resources to do so. I highly recommend this institution."
