"MichiganStateUniversity I like the atmosphere at MSU.MSU offers a lot of variety. Places to go, things to do, and classes to take. There are a lot of opportunities, however, because it's such a large place it's easy to get lost in the numbers. You need to be proactive about your college career and take control. A lot of people have gotten in trouble just listening to advisors, you need to double check what they tell you. The classes are large, if you don't go, know one cares. You need to introduce yourself to the professor and make it obvious that you are there to learn and are trying to succeed. My main complaint currently about MSU is the emphasis and money they place on football. Tutiton keeps going up and up, but we invest more and more into the stadium. Perhaps, if i could play football and go to college for free this wouldn't bother me..... Another issue is the city of East Lansing....they want your money, but they don't want you. They are constantly trying to cut down on the student housing and move everyone into large student housing groups in the Bath area (north of campus). The police care only about DUIs, disorder's and underage drinking. It's sad that the city and student body are so against one another. It's almost the opposite of U of M, where Ann Arbor enjoys the students and they have a great city and relationship to show for it."
