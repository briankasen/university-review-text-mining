"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark For my field of public health especially, University of Maryland is one of the best schools that you can attend. I thoroughly enjoy the school and believe that they have so many good qualities, however, a lot of those can be over-looked when you see the high tuition expenses for out of state students. And just like many other top schools, tuition is high and may be hard to pay, but I believe that there are many benefits of going to the university and proudly becoming an alumni."
