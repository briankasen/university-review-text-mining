"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln UNL is great school if you are able to push yourself and have the funds to attend. Student financial aid is not a priority, the faculty and staff are.  Most professors will make time for students but the class sizes in entry level courses keeps the relationships distant. If you live on campus be prepared to spend a lot of money for an out-dated room. Being on campus itself is really nice and you meet other students easily but the cost of room and board is almost equal to that of tuition."
