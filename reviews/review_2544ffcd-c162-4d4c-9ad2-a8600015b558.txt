"IndianaUniversityBloomington I have enjoyed my time here, but my time on campus has not been particularly great. I have found that there are few spots for students to really relax in-between classes, and  there is little to no parking for students who do not live on campus. I think there are great professors and the academics are good. I think there are some areas of study that are definitely favored, which has not made my time in college any better, but I think that might just be the culture here. Overall, I'm glad I came to here, because I met so many great friends and I love the college town and I think I will come out with a degree I am proud of."
