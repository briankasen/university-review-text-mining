"UniversityOfIowa It wasn't my first choice but now it's the only choice I've never looked back on. Sure, it's not perfect. Affordability is an issue for a lot of students, we get alerts of a crime in our campus bi-weekly, and we have a huge drinking scene. There's a lot of stuff that isn't great but when you look at it, Iowa is one of the best public universities for its community, standard for classes, and it's beauty. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
