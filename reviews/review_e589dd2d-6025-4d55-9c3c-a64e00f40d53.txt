PennsylvaniaStateUniversity It is a great campus with multiple opportunities for all students from all  areas of the world. The diversity on campus could be much better. Penn State hosts many events for students to have fun and learn more about career options for after graduation and many students already have job offers by the time they graduate. I highly recommend this university.
