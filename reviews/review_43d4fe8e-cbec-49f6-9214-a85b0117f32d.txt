"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, is a good school. It has good standing in most if not all of its departments. As a current engineering student, I can attest to the strength of the Clark School of Engineering. But, enough about academics. UMD is also a vibrant and fun community. Most students are willing to learn and happy to hang out or help you with homework or class. The campus is brimming with extracurricular activities and student organizations that are active and filled with students who are passionate about what they do. And, while UMD does have its faults such as some on-campus housing and the dorm food, I think it's a very good school for students. You'll definitely find a welcoming and academically rigorous community here."
