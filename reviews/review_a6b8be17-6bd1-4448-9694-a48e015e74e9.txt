"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign Sure U of I is in the middle of corn fields, but it is a beautiful campus. There are so many friendly people all around. A day like today where the sun is shinning, there are so many people out on the quad playing football, Frisbee, just talking, or doing homework. Sure they call us a party school, but there are so many more events and places to go to. Whether it is bowling night with friends or you are going to watch a play, or maybe sitting at the Follinger Auditorium under the beautiful night sky. One year at U of I and I love it!"
