RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers is such a big university.They offer many programs and degree options but they are not helpful and don’t provide much resources.Professors are there only for the paycheck.Most won’t have accessible office hours.They want students to be there longer than necessary. Even the counselors are very helpless. They pass you on without the right procedures and essential information. Students who really deserve help from professors are treated like they are not understood. The place keeps getting bigger and bigger. New brunswick yet is an amazing place to be .It offers a lot of room to travel to. It’s important to belong to a frat if you want to be invited to parties. Students seem like cheat their way to advance classes.Those who really learn by themselves are struggling.It is an experience where you learn to be hard skinned.It has not been a breeze.I have had to study long hours everyday and I still can’t manage to be an A student. Some people are naturally intuitive and others don’t have much light to use.But it is possible if you take it slow. Rutgers is very close to my home and very known in new jersey but outside in other states it’s like a new song. The life at university is different than the 9 to 5 workday.There is a lot of investment and pressure to do well in class. My hands hurt from all the typing .We leave everything for last minute. But fortunately that is when our minds worker better and faster. I have had to read instead of going out with my friends.It's all matter of decisions and misplaced meals. I have starved at school.My stomach grumbles during class but there is no time to eat a homemade meal .
