"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan provides a diverse community to grow in and learn from. There are many fantastic resources, such as on-campus libraries, technology labs, free tutor centers, and advisors. The campus itself is beautiful and comprehensive. There is a mixture of new and old architecture to enjoy, but all facilities are kept up-to-date on the interior.  The dining halls offer many varieties of food and often to cater to students with special dietary needs, such as vegetarian or gluten-free.  The University also has a great collection of staff including professors, graduate students, and other non-academic staff who keep the campus running smoothly. Greek life is highly active on campus, with many fraternities or sororities to choose from.  I personally am not involved in any Greek life, but it is available for students who are interested. I feel overall that one of the most positive aspects of the Michigan experience is the other students on campus. You get to interact with many different types of people every day, and I find that this definitely helps me both academically and socially. New people bring different opinions and knowledge to the table for you to learn from. Overall, one of the most negative aspects of the Michigan experience is the financial burden. This may apply to many other colleges, but I feel that a university as endowed and wealthy as the University of Michigan could afford to assist the students with more funds or lower prices. The financial aid payment plan in place does not help students who cannot pay their tuition or fees on time because it fines students for paying late, which is the point of enrolling in the payment plan. The University of Michigan is a great university. There is something here for everyone such as a wide array of extracurriculars, research opportunities, sports culture, greek life, and academic exploration. I encourage students to apply and attend."
