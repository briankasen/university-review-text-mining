"MichiganStateUniversity Michigan State is a great school because of the very diverse atmosphere. There are literally organizations to join any type of people. No matter what you like, you can be sure to find an organization that is a perfect fit for you. Also, Michigan State has one of the most beautiful campuses around. There are lots of on-campus resources to help make transitions easier. Since we  are a BIG 10 school, sports season is very exciting and I look foward to it every year."
