"UniversityOfIowa Honestly, I wish I enjoyed college as much as my peers seem to. I feel distance and quite frankly, an outcast. I'm not huge into sports but the Hawkeyes are considered living breathing demi-gods. I have met really wonderful professors, however. So I will not downplay that some (and I stress some) professors want to help and actually want you to succeed. Though I may not be having the time of my life, I will continue to try to find an inclusive group to boost my spirit on college life."
