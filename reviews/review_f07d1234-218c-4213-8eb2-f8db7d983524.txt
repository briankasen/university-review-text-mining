"NorthwesternUniversity I would say Soneni, time is of the essence, you are marching on and you must be prepared! There are great opportunities and no matter what, you must take advantage of all of the resources that are  available to you!  Choose your college, friends and associates wisely! leave all negativity behind! You are walking into a future that you are creating for yourself and  it will no doubt be tough but do not lose heart !  the future is greater than the moment!! make the best of all your experiences good or not so good and most of all keep God in your life and keep pressing on until you reach your destiny!"
