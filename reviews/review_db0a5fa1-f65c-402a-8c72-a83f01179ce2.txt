"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities In general, I really enjoy going to school at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.  As a Wisconsin resident, I was a little concerned about being able to meet new people in college because most of my friends attend school in Wisconsin.  However, the university offers many types of clubs and organizations that one can get involved in, and I made it a goal to be a part of at least one group.  I joined an accounting club, and that allowed me to meet some people with the same interests as me.  I've also met many people in my classes, some of whom have become close friends.  The only downside of attending school at Minnesota is the cost.  I've started looking at other schools to attend for my final two years of college in an effort to save my parents some money.  They've been really supportive throughout my academic career, and I want to help them out by earning some scholarships.  I really like this university, and I'm trying to do what I can to earn some money to finish my college career here."
