"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity I love the energy and atmosphere here on campus. There are always activities and fundraisers going on. It is really easy to get involved, especially in ""Thon"", a cancer fundraiser. the whole Penn state community participates in. The academic opportunities are endless and it really feels like everyone is apart of a a big family on campus."
