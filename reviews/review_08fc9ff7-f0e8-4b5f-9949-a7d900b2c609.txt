"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln It's a nice school, though parking prices and accessible spots leave little to be desired. There should be more academic support tools and tutors made available to every student no matter what their economic status is. Advisors seem overwhelmed, so smaller case loads for them would be beneficial."
