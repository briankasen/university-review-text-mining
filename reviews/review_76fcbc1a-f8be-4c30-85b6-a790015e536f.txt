"PurdueUniversity Purdue is an amazing college to attend if you don't mind the high cost and lack of competitive sports. There is no hockey or men's soccer. Football is atrocious. Basketball is usually good we hope. Out of state costs run around 45k per year. It's expensive. I grew up wanting to go to the university of Michigan and following their sports closely but I am happy here with academics. In terms of sports, I still follow Michigan and suggest you follow the team you grew up watching.  It'll be less of a heartache"
