UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark I love it here! I have grown so much socially and academically and can say that I've thrived. Some areas require improvement but overall really am having a great experience and plenty of opportunity to succeed. The classes are rigorous but they have such a strong preparatory major for veterinary school that I feel strongly in my career goals.
