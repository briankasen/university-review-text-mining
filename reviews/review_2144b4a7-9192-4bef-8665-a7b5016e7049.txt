"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor To me and countless others, the University of Michigan truly is a home away from home. Students here are extremely outgoing and open minded so intellectual conversation is easy to find here. Classes can be difficult, but they are truly worth it as you gain perspective in ways you would never imagine."
