"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity It's very beautiful! The class sizes vary depending on the class. For instance, my chem lecture has about 200 students in it. They have some of the best programs in the country, so academics are very prestigious, but it is expensive! It can get frustrating when they have state-of-the-art labs and stadiums, but still need to raise tuition.  Overall, its a good school."
