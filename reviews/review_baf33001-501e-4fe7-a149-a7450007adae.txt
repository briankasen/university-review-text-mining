PurdueUniversity I absolutely adore the campus for how large and accommodating it is for students. The buildings are beautiful and the services that are provided for students is incredible. The faculty is amazing in their pursuit of teaching us and giving us the best possible chance of graduating and succeeding in our future careers.
