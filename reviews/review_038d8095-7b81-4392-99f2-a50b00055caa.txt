"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities It's a really large campus. There's a lot going on, but most of it's parties, sports, and greek life. The dorms are pretty good for college, but are way more expensive than what you would pay off campus. Academics are incredible and accessible. If you can look past the size and price tag you'll like it there."
