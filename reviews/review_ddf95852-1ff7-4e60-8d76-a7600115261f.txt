"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan is a great school all around. It provides an inclusive and welcoming environment in which students can find a healthy academic challenge through unique and engaging classes.  The campus is beautiful and the location is excellent. Students can also find a sense of unity through the athletic programs and clubs.  The University of Michigan has everything I could ask for from a public college, and then some. I would highly recommend this school."
