"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor As a student coming from out of state I was concerned about the size however there are so many things to get involved in on campus-academic, social, philanthropic etc. There is never a dull moment here at UM and there is a perfect balance of work hard, play hard. Love Michigan-hoping time wills slow down because these 4 years are going way too fast!"
