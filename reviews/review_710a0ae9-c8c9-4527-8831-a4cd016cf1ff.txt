"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I love UW Madison. When I was applying to schools, I considered madison my ""back-up"" school. However, I visited campus and went to a football game and I never looked back. The campus is gorgeous, the students are genuine and the academics are globally recognized. I wouldn't trade going to Madison for anything. I am beyond happy with my decision."
