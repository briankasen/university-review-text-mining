"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln UNL is the perfect school for just about anyone, I'm going to be a freshman Fall 2017, and two of my sisters have attended. I always hear great things about it, and from my own experience, I always have a positive feeling when it comes to the school. I enjoy the convince of the surrounding stores and their academic excellence. Faculty, campus, extracurricular events, and more, meet and exceed the expectations of a University. I reccomend UNL to anyone interested in going to college in Nebraska."
