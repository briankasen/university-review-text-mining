"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I think UW-Madison is a great school! There are so many ways to get involved on campus. However, depending on the group you join, it may not be run the best, so the information might be hard to get (rely on emailing!). Lots of these organizations also realize you are a student here and studies come first, so there are many different levels of commitment. I would say the dorms are either what you should expect coming to college or better! UW-Madison probably has a renovation project or two every year to improve their facilities. Not gaining the ""freshman 15"" is also not a problem here with the SERF (a recreational facility) and such a big campus, you are always walking (which may be a downside). However, they do give the students a free bus pass that goes everywhere in Madison, so it is not too hard to go pick up food or go see a movie. The food on campus, for someone who is relatively picky, is actually pretty good! They always have fruits and vegetables (desserts, too), and a wide array of cuisine to choose from. Their course choice is also huge, too, almost intimidatingly so. The campus does offer and promote using  an adviser so that you  do not get overwhelmed with your choices. As expected, class size will be huge, but all professors hold office hours which are helpful, plus there are smaller discussions for some. Lastly, it goes without saying that the athletics here are phenomenal.
From someone who thought this school would be too big and not the environment that I wanted,  I can happily say I picked a good school."
