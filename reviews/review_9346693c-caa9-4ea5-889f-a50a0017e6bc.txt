"MichiganStateUniversity I love Michigan State University. No matter your personality type, you can thrive at this school. There are so many different groups and people you will meet, that there is no way you won't find friends. We know how to balance academics, work, and a social life.  I believe, though, that it is so important to join a club as a freshman, because this is a large university and you may feel lost within all the other people who appear to know what they are doing."
