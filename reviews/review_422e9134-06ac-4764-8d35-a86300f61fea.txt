"IndianaUniversityBloomington Overall my school is a great place. It is a representation of how the world really is to a certain degree. Everyone isn't nice or accepting; so you learn to deal with differences you may not have ran into in high school. If you care, your professors care. It is all of what you make it. Indiana University gives us the tools and skills in all aspects of life to be productive citizens of the world not just the U.S."
