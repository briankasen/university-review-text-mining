"OhioStateUniversity Ohio State is so huge that there's nothing you can't do. I haven't been here for that long and I'm already involved, and I'm already familiar with most of the sprawling campus. When I was looking at different colleges, I knew I wanted a ""collegy"" feel, so I balked at the idea of OSU's fairly ""urban"" setting -- I wanted it to feel like a college town. But at OSU, you actually get the best of both worlds. All of Columbus and definitely all of campus feels like its own world, especially because football is so important here. But at the same time, off-campus dining and activities are super accessible and your Student ID gives you discounts so you can explore off-campus food often. I LOVE OSU and you will too."
