RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick It has a reputation as a party school but it is so much more. The HUGE campus seemed ooverwhelming at first but I like it now. Professors are so cool and worldly that I changed my major to get more. 3/4 of the cafeterias are nice. The new livingston campus has the best of everything.
