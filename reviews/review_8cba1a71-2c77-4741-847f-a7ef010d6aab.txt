"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities It is a fairly large school with many amazing professors. My classes interest me a great deal and I quite enjoy it here! There are plenty of people to find a group of people that are like-minded, and there is always a new person or new experience to be had. The study areas are great, and there are many nice restaurants around campus."
