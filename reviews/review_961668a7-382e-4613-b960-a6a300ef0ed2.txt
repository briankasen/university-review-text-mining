RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers provides a plethora of opportunities and diversity whether its sports or clubs. Being at Rutgers has given students a place to explore and discover different places and people.  There is huge social aspect to Rutgers and the same goes for the academic side where the tutoring & studying groups are easily accessible. Its a huge campus since there are 5 different campuses but then you realize the world gets smaller and smaller once you begin to know more people. Its a wonderful school filled with opportunity and offered a good amount of financial aid which is why I attended.
