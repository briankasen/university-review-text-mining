"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I think this university has the possibility to fit everyone. Although for myself, I am a commuter student and I found it difficult to know when things were going on on campus and also felt like I couldn't really connect with people due to not living on campus. Although, the university provides a plethora of spaces to study and meet in a group and also has many outlets you can use to seek help in both academia and personal aspects. Overall, I do like UNL and just recommend making an active effort to be involved and on top of your studies."
