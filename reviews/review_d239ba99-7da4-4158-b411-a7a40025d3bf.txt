"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln Both of my parents are UNL allumni, so I have Husker blood pumping through my veins and I always will. However, unless you are a graduate student, a student athlete, or are somehow involved in the Greek system, you are more or less treated like another number. I graduated from UNL with my B.S. in 2014, and enrolled in a M.S. program in 2016, and the difference between the way I was treated as an undergrad compared to how I'm being treated as a graduate student is staggering. I believe it is a fantastic school to attend for a graduate degree. But as an undergrad, I think that you are better off going to a junior college and transferring your credits over once you have decided on a field of study."
