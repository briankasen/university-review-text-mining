"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I love this school. The campus environment is really nice and just makes you feel at home. There are plenty of stores and restaurants around campus. The greek life is really active, but there are also a lot of student groups if that's not your thing. The professors all want to see you succeed and will actively help you in your education."
