"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The school is big, and relatively expensive. The administration often makes decisions which the student body are opposed to, and which benefit the administrators financially. Facilities are generally nice, classes can be big but are quality, and there's always something to do. Dorms are hit and miss, and the cafeteria food is terrible."
