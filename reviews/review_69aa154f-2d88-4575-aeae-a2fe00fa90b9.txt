"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark I am a freshman and UMDCP, and so far my experience has been good. Since it is only my first semester I cannot speak on the school as a whole, but academics are relatively hard, and the dorms are standard but need major renovation.  The dining halls are terrible! The food here is so bad. The party scene is definitely present, with something going on almost every night."
