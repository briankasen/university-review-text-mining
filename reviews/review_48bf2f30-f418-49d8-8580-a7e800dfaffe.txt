"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Its a great environment to be in , and it makes me feel like i'm a part of something really big. Nonetheless, they're things that could be tweaked, to make the environment in class and outside of class enjoyable. Things like providing students with cheaper books or shrinking class sizes in order for each student to get the most of it from each class ."
