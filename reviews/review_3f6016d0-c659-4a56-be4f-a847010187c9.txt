UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I like the University of Illinois. It’s almost always something to do and there’s always somewhere to be. The students are pretty nice and the food is really good. The class sizes are relatively normal unless your class is extremely popular. The classes are not too difficult. You have to pay attention. The staff is super helpful and informative.
