"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark Its a great school! Everyone here is so friendly and warm! For such a big school, there is this major feeling of community that is incredible! Every time I walk out my door, I always run into someone I know. The professors here are also great for the most part. They're all very willing to help you if you reach out to them"
