"PurdueUniversity Purdue University-Main Campus is a phenomenal campus to join. Before the first week of school starts, Purdue hosts something called Boiler Gold Rush where first year students come in a week early to join in on activities to get comfortable with campus. At this week long event, many friends are formed and students begin to feel like they are at home. As the school year begins, the campus is buzzing with students all around as homework starts to roll in and the football team begins playing games. Academics are hard at Purdue but are well worth it for the friends a student acquires during their college years. In terms of dining courts, it is hard to get tired of the food because there is always different food. It also helps Purdue has 5 different food courts a student can eat at. Each one has a completely different menu. If a student has no time to sit at a dining court, they can swing on by On-the-Go!, a mini mart where students can use meal swipes to purchase an entree and 3 snacks and a drink or 4 snacks and a drink. Homework is bountiful and earning good grades is a difficult process but can be achieved.  There are always office hours regardless of what professor you have. Purdue sports has seen a recent uplift as the main sports teams, football and basketball, begin to improve more and more. Purdue students are excited with the direction these teams are heading in. Overall, Purdue is a phenomenal school for not only academics but for its social environment and culture. The students make Purdue a better college every single year."
