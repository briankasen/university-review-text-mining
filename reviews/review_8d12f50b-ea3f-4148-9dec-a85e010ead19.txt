"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers is a well-rounded school. If you're intelligent, you will find your community at the Honors College or similar programs. If you're into sports and clubs, we have plenty of things to get involved in. Plus, it is a huge research university with a variety of jobs, internships, and opportunities available for everyone. I do not regret attending this university at all."
