"PurdueUniversity It's an amazing university. The only warnings I would give are the math and physics departments and the cafeteria food. The physics department is always disorganized (one exam I had started 15 minutes late because of this), and most engineering students either take math classes in the summer or try to take it at the local Ivy Tech. The cafeteria food has been going downhill in the last few years, used to be amazing. Everything else is amazing, plenty of extracurriculars, many basic shops near campus and the buses go to two Walmarts and a Meijer, so if you don't have a car, you can get enough to drag onto the bus. Most professors will be willing to work with you if you just talk to them, although a few won't respond to emails unless during business hours."
