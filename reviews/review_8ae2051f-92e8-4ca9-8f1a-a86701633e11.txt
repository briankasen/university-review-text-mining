"PurdueUniversity Purdue is an amazing school. The academics are very hard but are well-earned. If you get an A at Purdue, you know it truly means an A. The sports are super important since we are a big 10 school. The overall environment is amazing. There are plenty of options for food at the dining courts so you will never go hungry, and there are many opportunities for jobs, clubs, or greek life."
