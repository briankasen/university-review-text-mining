"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a phenomenal college for students to attend because of its great atmosphere. I absolutely love how you can always just walk outside to the Quad or Illini Union and there will always be SOMETHING going on! If there's nothing going on indoors such as at the Union, the Undergraduate Library, or Krannert Center, then there are outdoor activities on the Quad for people to watch and do (such as kite flying, drum playing, watching squirrels, or juggling)! The security at this school is pretty strong; I usually feel safe when I go out, even at night. I have never seen more squirrels anywhere in my life than here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign because I personally have encountered seeing a couple of squirrels just casually sitting on top of a garbage can pecking at some pizza or cookies. It was absolutely adorable. The other time I ran into a squirrel was when I was on my way to a meeting at the University YMCA building. I saw a group of people crowding around a tree and looking up at the sky. I stopped walking, took a quick peek at what they were looking at, and saw a fat squirrel sitting on a branch in the tree eating a whole slice of pizza! This made my day because it was cute to watch and I know I would never have been able to seen something this adorable in my hometown, Chicago. Overall, I love attending this university because it provides me with so much happiness where I am able to have a fun social life while getting a degree in Nursing simultaneously."
