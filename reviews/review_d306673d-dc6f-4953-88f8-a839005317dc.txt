"PurdueUniversity I hate college, and Purdue has cemented the belief that a collegiate education is a ludicrous idea when going into the tech field. We live in a world of endless knowledge thanks to the internet and half my classes say that we as the students will have to teach a concept to ourselves by googling it because it's an important skill to maintain."
