"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor U of M is a great school that provides so many opportunities for their students! The academics are challenging, but if you put in the work success is possible! The campus has a great atmosphere that makes you want to be there! Ann Arbor is a great location that makes the college experience much better! Also, the athletics surround the university and make us a tight knit community of students on gamedays!"
