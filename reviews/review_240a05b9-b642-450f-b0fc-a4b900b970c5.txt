"MichiganStateUniversity I really love Michigan State University. It may appear to be a huge campus, but it truly becomes a smaller community once you get used to it. I love how beautiful it is and East Lansing, MI all together. I've met a lot of cool professors and food services provide great food ! MSU is what you made it!"
