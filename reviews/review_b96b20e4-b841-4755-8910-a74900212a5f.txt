"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln A great school and place to call home. I love the two separate campuses (city and east). City is like a typical college campus and East has a sort of 'small-town feel,' Either campus, you find your way to fit in and are welcomed with open arms.  Greek life is great but not for everyone. Very optional and fine either way."
