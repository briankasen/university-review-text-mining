"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison It is a wonderful school. It has a strong academic standing and a lot of extracurricular activities that allow people to participate in.  The teacher are wonderful, they take out their time to explain and be available for students that will need help in their subject. We have a strong sport atmosphere especially for football. There is a lot of research opportunity .  One place to visit is the Wisconsin Terrace. There is a lot of music, people, and a beautiful view of the lake."
