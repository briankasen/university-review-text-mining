"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison We may be the #1 party school in the U.S. but we know when it's time to get down to business. Classes are wonderful and I genuinely enjoy going. You haven't experience college football until you step foot in Camp Randal on game days and jump around. If you think you found the best pizza you're wrong (unless it's Ian's Pizza). You haven't fully experienced summer until you sit on the Memorial Union Terrace in the colorful, unique chairs and stare at the lake. There's nothing like it!"
