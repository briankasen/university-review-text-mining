"PurdueUniversity Since, I was a little girl, I have dreamt of being a boilermaker. When people ask me where I attend college, itâ€™s a privilege to say Purdue University. It is a place to make unforgettable memories and a place you will never want to leave. Purdue has everything and anything you can think of. The campus is sensational, to its historical buildings to West Lafayette itself. Going away to college is a scary, new step but Purdue makes you feel right at home. Being a Boilermaker is more than just a saying, it is who you are for the rest of your life.
