"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I am going to be a sophomore at UW-Madison this fall. Overall, I really like my campus.  My freshman year, I lived in the dorms like many students on campus. The quality of the dorms really depends on which dorm you select. Newer dorms like Leo and Smith are going to be a lot nicer and bigger than the older ones. Some dorms even include A/C and walk in closets. The food on campus is pretty good, but it gets boring after a while. But when you get bored of the dinning hall food, there are tons of places to eat on State st."
