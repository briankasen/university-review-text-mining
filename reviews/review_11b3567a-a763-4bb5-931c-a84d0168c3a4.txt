"NorthwesternUniversity Northwestern's academics are great, the social scene is really what you make of it, and the campus is absolutely beautiful. As a journalism major in Medill, there's also an extensive alumni network which is very involved in student life and lots of opportunities outside of the classroom that students are encouraged to take advantage of."
