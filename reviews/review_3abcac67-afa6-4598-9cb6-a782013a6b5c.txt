RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers has been a great place to me. It is where I found my passions and is also the place where I found the activities that I really enjoy doing. There are all kinds of people here and you would be hard pressed to not find something to do. Overall Rutgers is a blessing in disguise to the many people who enroll here.
