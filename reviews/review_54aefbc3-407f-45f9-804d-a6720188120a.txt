"NorthwesternUniversity I love it.  Although I am only a Freshman, everyone has been incredibly kind and helpful, both while I toured and as I prepare for move-in day. Northwestern has an amazing academic reputation, and I can tell from the class Facebook page that I'm going to make a lot of friends while I'm here.  Everyone seems so excited, smart, and creative; I can't wait to get started! My only minor issue is that my schedule won't be finalized until I meet with an advisor on campus after moving in. I like that someone will review my schedule, but I'd rather be prepared and know my schedule well in advance."
