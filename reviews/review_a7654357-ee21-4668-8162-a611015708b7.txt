"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I've only been at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities for a few months now and I've been mostly enjoying it. I knew that it was a huge campus with a lot of people, but I didn't expect it to be this overwhelming; so you will feel sort of useless/tiny in some way.  However, the UMN offers many clubs; if you join a club or two, the feeling of being a useless/tiny gopher on campus will eventually disappear."
