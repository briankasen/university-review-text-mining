"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity It is a wonderful college. It may be big. Some of my classes have a ton of kid in it. That is necessary for some of these first year prerequisite classes though. My goal is always to make it a small university by joining groups and using the many opportunities. Anything you want to do, Penn State can make happen"
