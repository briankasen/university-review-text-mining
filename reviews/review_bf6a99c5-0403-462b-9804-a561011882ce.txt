"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I love going to the university of Minnesota. There are a few downsides however. I'm not going to lie dorm life is not for me. It is quite noisy pretty much all the time. On the flip side, I have met one of my closest friends here! The academics are amazing here and you really feel like you go to a prestigious university. I personally really love how big the campus is and how many people go here. I feel like I am meeting a new person every day! If you like the city and like to meet new people, the U of M is definitely a great place to be."
