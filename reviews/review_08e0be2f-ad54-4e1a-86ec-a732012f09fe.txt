"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a variety of opportunities for students to get involved and those who are already involved are obviously passionate about what they do. Everyone is pretty friendly and smiles back and sometimes even engages in small conversations. This school offers almost anything you could ask for at a college. One of the benefits that I have noticed is that this is a dry campus meaning that no alcohol is tolerated. I personally believe that this has a huge impact on the safety and academic success of students here. Also, in 2018 the campus will become tobacco-free as well! This is even better because there will be no more fast walks through smoke clouds while holding your breath."
