"OhioStateUniversity A concern of mine was that Ohio State would be too big, and it is a large campus, but the communities you choose to involve yourself in make it small.  I see people I know all the time all over campus, without prior planning.  There is also always so much going on, for everyone on campus.  If you don't want to go out and drink, there is no pressure.  We have Greek life, but it doesn't dominate campus life.  Ohio State is a place where you learn about yourself, be you and feel happy and accepted.  I can't imagine going to a different school for my undergrad.  Go Bucks!"
