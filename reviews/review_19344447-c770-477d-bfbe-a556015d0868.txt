"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Ah, The University of Minnesota. Specifically, the Twin Cities campuses, including East Bank, West Bank, and the Saint Paul Campus. Its large campuses allow for lots of spaces for students to walk around, study, eat and hang out with friends. With hot summers and frigid winters, you'll surely enjoy walking around on campus with either the bare minimum on or packed with goose feathers and seeing penguin-like figures slip and slide."
