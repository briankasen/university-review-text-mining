"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick For a state school, Rutgers is amazing. There is so many resources that are available and they really make you feel special even though you are one kid out of 30,000. So glad I go to Rutgers! There is something for everyone. I am a part of Scarlet Honor Council and also I work at Busch Student Center and I feel like through these organizations I've met some of my closest friends and people with the same mindset as me. Rutgers is known as a party school, but if that is not your thing then honestly its fine. There is plenty to do!"
