"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor Academics are very good, and with such a large student body there is every type of person imaginable. The school is very liberal, with bias training required and even allowing students to choose their pronouns on attendance sheets. They will protest literally anything. Football is huge though. Go blue!"
