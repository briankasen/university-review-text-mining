"IndianaUniversityBloomington I am obsessed with IU - B. From the amazing campus, athletics, social atmosphere, and plenty to keep you busy, this campus has it all. I am from a nearby town and have always visited Bloomington, but living on campus is so must different than a casual visit. IU B is home for many, including myself."
