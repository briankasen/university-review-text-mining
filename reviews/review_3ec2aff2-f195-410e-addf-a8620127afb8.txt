"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers University includes a lot of diversity and culture. Students from all over the world travel and study at Rutgers University due to it's demanding and rigorous academic majors. Rutgers is known to be inclusive and open to many different opinions. It is a large school, which allows many people to meet others rather easily. Though they may flaw in a few aspects in regard to financial aid or course necessity and applications, I personally think it's a great school to attend!"
