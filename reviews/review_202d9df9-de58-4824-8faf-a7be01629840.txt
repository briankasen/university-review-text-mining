"UniversityOfIowa Stepping onto the University of Iowa's campus I was put into joy. Everybody surrounding me seemed so friendly. Students around me were smiling and some even took the time to talk to me while we were walking around. I feel many campuses do not have that feel to them at all. Not only were the people on the campus welcoming and friendly, but so were the administration. All of the teachers seem very easy to talk to and discuss whatever one may need to discuss with them. One of my favorite parts about the University of Iowa is that when it comes to game time the campus is ready to support their classmates while they take on their opponents, but we don't let that take away from our learning and studying. Both are major aspects about being a Hawkeye, but the University of Iowa does an amazing job of making both of those happen. Supporting fellow classmates and having time for studying and school work."
