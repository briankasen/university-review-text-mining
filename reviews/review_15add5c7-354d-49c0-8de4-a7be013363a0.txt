OhioStateUniversity I just love The Ohio State University ! There is always something to do whether it is in the thriving city of Columbus or right on campus.  No matter how big it seems everyone is a part of the buckeye family.  Academics are fantastic from the TAs to the Professors. The opportunities are outstanding.
