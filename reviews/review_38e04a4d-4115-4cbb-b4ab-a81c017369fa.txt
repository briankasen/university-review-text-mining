"UniversityOfIowa The University of Iowa provides an abundance of opportunities inside and outside of the classroom. Although it's a big ten school, you feel a sense of belonging and comfort on campus, knowing that you make a difference and can be heard. There are countless clubs to get involved in and always events being hosted, giving great ways to meet new people. Being so close to downtown also gives people the chance to get away from academics when needed to relax and go out with friends. When it comes to academics, the university provides endless ways to get help-- tutoring, going to Supplemental Instruction, office hours, study groups, etc. The professors always make an effort to provide assistance when needed as well. I'm just a few months into my first semester here and I already know I'm a part of something great."
