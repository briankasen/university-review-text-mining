"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Great Campus for a variety of reasons, may not be the best fit for everyone. If you stick around the right people, you will find your place. Depending on your major, you may have to put in effort to find the right people, but Campus really offers lots of opportunities to do and experience things more often than not. Time and your own personal comfort zone are your only limitations for how you will enjoy this college."
