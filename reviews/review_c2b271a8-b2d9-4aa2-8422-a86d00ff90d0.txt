"OhioStateUniversity I love the campus and everything Ohio State offers inside and outside of the classroom, I have gotten so many opportunities that I didn't even know existed because of how connected the campus is. Although some of the facilities need to be updated I know OSU is doing their best in beginning restoration of older buildings."
