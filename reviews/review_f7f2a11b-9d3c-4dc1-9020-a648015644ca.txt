"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities My experience at this school has been great so far! Although it is a huge campus, all of the different student groups/ activities can make it feel smaller! It’s amazing how you’re able to personalize your own college experience. The academics is pretty good too. The professors are very passionate about what they teach which makes learning the subject better! From the professors I’ve had, they’ve explained the material well and are always available to meet with students. The professors want to see the students to achieve."
