"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I went to u of I with hope of improvements for my life and a good education but instead I got a drug and alcohol filled hell hole with a bunch of fake greek life queers. This place has caused me to go into a chronic depression and with all hope lost for my future and this country. Not only did this place make me hate college and my life but my own country as well. This country likes to force debt upon people who can't even get a real job yet just so people can go to school and get a degree and learn almost nothing when instead you could just start working out of high school. Basically my main point is if you have depression or just don't like the drinking and party scene, please don't go here. This place should give me all the money I spent back because I've spent thousands of dollars just to put myself in an abyss of depression. I regret going here with my entire being and hate this place with a passion."
