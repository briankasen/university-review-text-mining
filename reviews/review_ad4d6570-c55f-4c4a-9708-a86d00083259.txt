"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign My honest opinion about the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is that there is a nice balance for so many things including academics and partying and it suits well for in-state, out-of-state, and international students. It’s a very big university to be outside of Chicago and is a nice college town. If there is something you want to talk about, you have the power and you have the voice. People on campus will listen to what you need to say. The university is always beaming of school pride, even when it comes to sports (which we are not so good at). We have more than 1100 RSOs which are equal to high school clubs. Illinois has so many resources and people to help with whatever problem one may have, and this isn’t seen at other universities. A very good benefit of going to Illinois is that the professors are required to teach the lectures. For discussion sections, the TAs are there to help the students with any questions or doubts they may have. Being on such a large campus, there is so much to do and so many new people to meet. When I first moved on campus, I was a little bit overwhelmed with how big the University is. However, later I realized that this is preparing me for post-graduation, when I get sent out into the real workplace. The benefit of a big school is that there are always niches, and you can find a comfort zone anywhere, but most importantly, is that you will not graduate as a sheltered person."
