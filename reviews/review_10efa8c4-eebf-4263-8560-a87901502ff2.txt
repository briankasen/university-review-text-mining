"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark UMD is a great school depending on your area of study. For a state school, it has amazing programs for an extremely affordable price. However, I am out of state which makes affordability an issue. The sports scene and party scenes are great and there is always stuff to be doing around campus!"
