"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I am a junior at the U and it has its pros and cons. The dorm life sucks. They don't clean well, the food sucked, and good luck if you don't live in 17th. BUT it's a prestigious school so the academics are hard, but the class sizes are way smaller than I expected. The only classes that are really large are your common introductory classes. The professors have very limited office hours but they are in the offices during those times. Game days are huge at the U. You won't go to every game, but you will go to most of them. There is always a nightlife and there are a lot of good restaurants nearby and it's great being next to downtown Minneapolis."
