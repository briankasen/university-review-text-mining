"MichiganStateUniversity Michigan State University is a really great school for a wide range of students. The classes are academically challenging and encourage students to reach their full potential and at the same time, there is an active social scene for those students who are interested in those kinds of things. The campus is beautiful and there is a great school spirit and student body camaraderie. I would really recommend students to consider Michigan State as their school."
