"MichiganStateUniversity Michigan State University has a lot of resources. It has many different school programs as well, any and almost every club. For example, a squirrel watching club. My issue though is the diversity, being that the school is predominantly white you do run into issues, of bigotry, racism, and many different ideologies. Which becomes places to the students of those minorities to speak out against and to say something or the voices won't be heard. This makes it hard for me, as someone who is African American, having to explain to a University that I give thousands of dollars to, that as a paying costumer I matter, and they should see me verses my worth. I enjoy the resources that are available, but I wish when it came to world issues, MSU would get more involved to let their students know, that they see and hear them, despite what is going on in the world. For all we as students know, is MSU sides with these bigot, and racist, ideologies."
