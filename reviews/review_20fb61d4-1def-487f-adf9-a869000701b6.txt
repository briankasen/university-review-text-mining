"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison When I first came to the UW-Madison campus, I felt incredibly small and overwhelmed by the turbulent life bustling all around me. But, given time plenty of time between the move-in date and the first day of class, I came to love and enjoy the campus. The campus, more than the dozen places I've lived in my life, is my home. I have met the most wonderful, diverse, and continuously interesting people I could ever hope to. Students on campus help one another regardless of self-interest. Madison really works on forming a strong, cohesive community of students, and it excels at doing so. I joined a learning community, The Studio, and it helped me find people, opportunities, and fun on campus. Learning communities at UW-Madison are only a few hundred more on top of Housing, so it's rather quite worth your money and time. Because, at the end of this year, I know I'll be several steps ahead of other university students who did not get the benefit of constant academic and internship personnel. The University of Wisconsin-Madison is, by far, one of the most welcoming environments I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying."
