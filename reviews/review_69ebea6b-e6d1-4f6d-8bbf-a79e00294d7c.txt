IndianaUniversityBloomington I love IU as a school so far. I spent my freshman year at Penn State and as a comparison between the two I much prefer to spend my time at IU simply because the atmosphere is more accepting than that of Penn State. While being a student at penn state I felt as though I had to be involved in many activities and in a sorority to fit in with those around me while at IU I can enjoy my time with myself and my friends without the pressure of being apart of something like a sorority group.
