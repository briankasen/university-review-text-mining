"MichiganStateUniversity Michigan State University is what ever you want it to be. Whether you're introverted or extroverted, book worm or party animal, MSU is for you. There are so many resources on and off campus, it's crazy. I've only been at MSU for one semester and can't wait for the next.
GO GREEN! GO WHITE! GO STATE!"
