"UniversityOfIowa The university of iowa has made me feel welcome and invited the whole time I have attended. It also has a variety of students and culture that was never prevalent in my home worn. Discrimination is not a big thing there and inclusivity is almost always available. The people are inviting and welcoming to new people and do not come off as negative or uninterested. People there genuinely seem to enjoy themselves and feel safe, such as I do"
