"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison The University is a great place for a great education and a to meet new people. There are always things to do on campus both if you need a study break and if you need people to study with. The badger community to all about helping every one grow and reach their potential. I have both seen and experienced this from staff and students throughout my time at UW. There is a love for the University that can be seen and felt anywhere, especially on game days. There is no place I'd rather go to school than here, and I think that it is worth considering  no matter what major you are looking into. You will get both a great education and have an amazing college experience as a badge."
