"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers is encompassed of four distinct campus,  with each campus having its unique qualities.  I personally loved all four campus and the open space that I was able to use.  I also loved the diversity that could be found at Rutgers and different groups of people anyone can easily ground themselves into. People here, including the professors, are very friendly and they are more than willing to help you out if needed. If you love the big, lively school, you'll definitely feel at home at Rutgers!"
