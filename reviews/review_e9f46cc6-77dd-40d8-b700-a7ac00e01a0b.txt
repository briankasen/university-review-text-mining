"IndianaUniversityBloomington Exceptional blend of every aspect you could ever hope for at a University. I am also a student-athlete, in the Kelley School of Business, and LOVE Bloomington. It is an incredible college-town and the atmosphere is undeniably the best I have ever experience. There is a strong sense of community and support, while also striving towards excellence in sport and in the classroom, all while having an absolute blast."
