"IndianaUniversityBloomington It is an incredibly good school. It is not well-ranked overall, but this is because Indiana (the state) has a mission-split where Purdue focuses on STEM+ majors (which improves rankings) while IU focuses on social sciences/arts & humanities. Also, because people do not expect IU to be as rigorous as it is, students drop out and decrease the retention rate.  The Kelley School of Business is home to absurdly smart and innovative students and is easily an ""elite"" business school, both undergrad and graduate. It has been ranked top 10 undergrad for the past 4 or 5 years and will continue to rise for sure. The Jacobs School of Music is also the best in the world, housing some insanely talented students. Campus life is fun. The student body is very diverse. There are those that do not care for intellectual conversations, but there are many that are ready to speak extemporaneously about obscure socio-politico-economic topics. IU does not often get the credit it deserves."
