"UniversityOfIowa I enjoy going to the University of Iowa. It was a big change transferring from a small private college to the U of I, but it was worth it and I am very glad I transferred. I have met some amazing people and have been offered some great opportunities that I would not have gotten the chance to participate in if I would have stayed at my previous college."
