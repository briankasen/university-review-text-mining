"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign This university is very diverse and there are always numerous options on this campus.  There are many types of restaurants and places to go, if you just want to get coffee with someone or if you want to go and have a sit down meal. The academics are high quality and because the institution is research based, the curriculum is current. You can find students from a wide range of majors interacting. The facilities are well kept even though some are older but it brings a history and character to the buildings. Most of the newer buildings are made well and the use of space is very creative. The students on this campus are active and welcoming."
