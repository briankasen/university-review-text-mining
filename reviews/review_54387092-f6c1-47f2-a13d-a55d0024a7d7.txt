"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick It's a huge campus, comprised of five smaller campuses. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and lost in the large population of students. However, there are tons of opportunities available for students if they seek them out. As a freshman, I didn't enjoy the large lectures but as I delved into my coursework, smaller seminars offered a lot of learning and connection with the professors. I don't like how everything is super competitive, there's definitely an air of that here. However, we all try to make the best of it. We're here to learn together and that's the only way we are going to move forward."
