"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I think that if you are going into the engineering, it is a great school. It takes a big pride in Computer Science programs, but the problem is that it is getting a bit too crowded. It is also known as a party school, and there are plenty social gatherings to be found.  We also have a sister college in China so there are many international students too. This university does have lots of benefits, and the professors that I had so far were very kind and intelligent."
