"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark Overall, it's a pretty decent atmosphere and fairly good at making a big campus small with clubs and activities. As for the facilities, some of the buildings are clearly aging and rather than fixing those, there's a lot of money going into new buildings and athletics. Freshman dorms are just kind of sad--not all of them even have A/C. There's always a problem with the Wi-Fi or the online homework systems. These are all kind of minor things that take away from the overall positive atmosphere on campus."
