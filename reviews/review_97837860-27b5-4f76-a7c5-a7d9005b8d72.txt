"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison As a transfer student, instantly upon my arrival to campus, while I was in the airplane landing at the nearest airport, in Madison. I could see the campus directly out of my window, and my face was filled with joy and excitement. To see the gorgeous lakes and bright luminous green from the trees and grass, I was thrilled to see the area in person.    Once I step foot on campus I knew finally I found home in Madison, to see the beautiful scenery and people, it was a feeling of redamancy, to have the return  and share of love. Everyone was greeting each other, smiling, and hugging. We all just embrace one another to make sure everyone's stay is the same feeling of home. I am so thankful and blessed to be able to say I am a Wisconsin Badger."
