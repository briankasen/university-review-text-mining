"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark This is the worst university on earth. I am a Maryland resident and they made me pay out-of- state tuition. I changed my residency status during my first semester by providing the documents needed. I got the in-state tuition but at the end of the semester they changed it back to out-of-state, claiming that I was missing a document. I was stressed out because I had to pay double the tuition out of my pocket just like that. I was at Montgomery college last year paying in-state tuition, and I transferred through the umd program. THEY KNOW I AM A RESIDENT!!! THEY JUST WANT MONEY!!! I hired a lawyer to help me get the additional document needed (that’s another 20,000$) only to get a refund and change my status. Then they told me that I wont get a refund. I wasted 40,000$ at this school. I was at the residency office almost everyday trying to prove that I am a resident. Come on I have been living here for 3 years! The residency office people are very very rude and not helpful. Terrible . Very very terrible. So unprofessional. I do not recommend this school to anybody. If they’re gonna make me pay 50,000 a year I might as well go to Harvard. Peace ✌️"
