"UniversityOfIowa The University of Iowa is a really big school, with big classes. However, that only makes it more special. They create events and opportunities for you to connect with anyone you want, and they also have big group photos for each graduating class (which makes the ""big school part"" great). Lastly, the classes are hard enough that they will prepare you for anything the future throws at you."
