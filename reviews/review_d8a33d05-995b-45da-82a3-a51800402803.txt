"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln It is a great school that provides a wide variety of opportunities to every major. The school has may tools at your disposal such as academic ad visors, places for you to study, and even people to meet with that will help you plan for a job out of college.  It's a larger school but it is very easy to make it feel small. I wouldn't want to go to school anywhere else."
