"PurdueUniversity I loved Purdue! The only thing I would do different is live off campus after my first year to save money. 
Students have lots of opportunity to get involved, meet new people, and progress as people.  The night life is great for 21+. Frats and social groups have events for those younger. Lots of intelligent people around."
