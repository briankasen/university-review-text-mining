"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The University of Maryland - College Park is a great school for the in-state tuition price. I do not think I would pay for out of state tuition but college prices in the U.S. are all excessive. I guess that is why I am doing this review.  This is a great atmosphere and would recommend, any Maryland residents interested in Engineering, to go to this school."
