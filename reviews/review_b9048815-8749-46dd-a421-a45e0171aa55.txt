"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Warm welcoming environment. Honestly, was not sure how I would feel coming to a huge university, but the community at this college made me feel like I belong and it's extremely easy to find your niche. I've only been here for a year, and I'd have to say the place has really grown on me. Definitely feel like the place is my second home. :)"
