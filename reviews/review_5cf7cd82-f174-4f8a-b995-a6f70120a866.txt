"UniversityOfIowa University of Iowa was one of my last choices but when I visited the campus. My whole perspective of the school changed. There was so many ways for a student to get help in any of there classes. They have office hours, ta sessions and so much more. It is very easy for a student to get academically. There is also such a good support system. The advisors are very helpful with emotional issues as well as academic issues.  There is so much diversity if in the campus I can always can meet someone new."
