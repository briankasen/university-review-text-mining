"PurdueUniversity Purdue is a challenging large campus school and it can be difficult for introverts to make friends. However, Purdue does encourage being an active student and has many opportunities, having over 1000 clubs. Purdue wants its students to prosper, by having several weed-out classes (especially for engineering students). Purdue is multi-cultured and educated, however, there can be intense racial issues on campus."
