"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is an overall excellent institution of learning. I cannot speak for the other colleges, but as a member of the College of Biological Sciences, I feel that I am extremely well taken care of. Professors are well-spoken and have a great background in what they teach. They are also very approachable people that are flexible in terms of meeting for questions and general concerns. Other than the academics, the overall environment of the campus is very welcoming. Being a very large school, there is an opportunity to meet a diverse range of individuals in and out of the classroom in a very accepting atmosphere. Whether I am in the dorms, in Dinkytown, or in class, I feel that everyone respects the ideas of others and who they are as individuals."
