"PurdueUniversity Purdue is great! I wasn't entirely sure it was the right fir for me (I'm out of state), but I like it here, a lot! It's very important to get involved early because it is a big campus and you want to find 'your people' pretty soon, but there's lots to do on campus. There's tons of opportunities to learn, grow, and have fun!"
