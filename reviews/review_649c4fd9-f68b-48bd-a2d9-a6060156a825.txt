"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor Michigan is an amazing school that makes you grow up fast! (Both Academically and individually) It's a school where you have to learn how to move fast and kick butt. Academics are the strong suit here where classes are rigorous and challenging, but support can be found all over campus in the forms of office hours, impassioned students and tutoring labs. Biggest drawback, campus is hard to navigate during final exams because of heavy traffic."
