"IndianaUniversityBloomington I love IU! It kind of has a reputation for being a party school, but I still felt at home and comfortable even though I never party. I lived in an honors dorm which was the best decision for me because I quickly found a group of friends that had similar interests and goals as myself. There are also an endless amount of opportunities to get involved around campus through clubs, activities, and organizations."
