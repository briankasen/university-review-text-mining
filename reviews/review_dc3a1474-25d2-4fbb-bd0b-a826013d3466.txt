"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers University-New Brunswick is a place where everyone feels like a small fish in a big pond. The five campuses sprawl across New Brunswick and Piscataway, New Jersey, making it easy to get overwhelmed at the number of events happening every day. There is an abundance of ways to get involved and find your niche even if requires trial-and-error over the course of your first two years. Classes can range from 200-person lecture halls to intimate classroom settings with many professors who genuinely care about their students and make themselves available to reach out to. However, the bus system that takes students from campus to campus can become a hassle with long waiting times and overcrowded buses. This problem is exacerbated during exam week and rush hour, making it the single most pervasive issue of attending an institution such as Rutgers. The quality of food varies widely depending on the campus, but the culture of each campus makes the college interesting and a place where there are endless things to explore even if it lacks the appeal of cities such as New York or Boston. The stress of registering for classes that fill up quickly and having to pull your own weight in terms of navigating the college experience can become daunting in an institution of 30,000+ students. The relationships you foster with your professors, faculty, and advisors feel less personal unless you actively keep up with them since there are many students to keep track of. However, Rutgers teaches you discipline and independence in ways that other schools do not, which makes the experience worthwhile and pushes you to make your mark in the larger campus community."
