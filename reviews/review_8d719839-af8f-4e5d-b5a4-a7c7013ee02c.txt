IndianaUniversityBloomington I love the campus and the people. It is a beautiful place to live and I cannot wait to be back. The academic community is incredible and I have met some of the brightest people at IU. It truly has an opportunity for every interest and lifestyle. The people down in Bloomington are some of the greatest people I've ever met.
