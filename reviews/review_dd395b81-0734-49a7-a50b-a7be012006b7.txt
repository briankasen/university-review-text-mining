"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity I love Penn State, so far it has been a great experience. I love that I'm actually interested in what my professors are teaching, that's what makes it different from my high school experience. I also like that our professors encourage us to stop by during their office hours to talk about the class and build relationships with them."
