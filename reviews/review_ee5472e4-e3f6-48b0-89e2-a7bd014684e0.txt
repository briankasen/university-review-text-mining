"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I think the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a great school with a variety of learning and extra curricular opportunities. There's something there for everybody and it's easy to find people with similar interests to your own. The housing is great and surprisingly affordable, especially their apartment style housing. Students are able to do hands on learning that will prepare them for their chosen career. UNL is a very high-qualityâ€‹ school."
