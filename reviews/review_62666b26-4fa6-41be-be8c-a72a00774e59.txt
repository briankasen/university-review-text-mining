"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln It is a good school. There are a lot of opportunities to prep you for  your career, you just have to take advantage of them. There's a large emphasis on sports here, academics are pretty good. It is a safe environment. They could do better for student parking and housing since they want more students here."
