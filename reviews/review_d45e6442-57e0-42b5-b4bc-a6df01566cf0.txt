"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a place where I feel at home. There is always something to do. The campus is large, which makes it easier to meet more people. However, the setup of the campus makes it feel smaller and more like a home. The professors are very approachable and knowledgeable in their field."
