"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I think your experience at UW-Madison really depends on your interests. Love sports? You are in the right place! Like to ""work hard, and play harder?"" You will fit right in! 
Do you want to have some of the benefits of a larger city (restaurants, arts, activities) but feel like you're in a small town? Madison is a good spot. Unfortunately, I wasn't much into sports, recreational drinking, or a rural feel so I never really felt like I fit here. You can find little niches to accommodate your interests, it's just that some are a little harder to find."
