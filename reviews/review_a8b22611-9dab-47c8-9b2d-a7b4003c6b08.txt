"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Unlike the many fanatical, school-spirited students on this campus, my decision to come to Penn State student was mostly accidental.  I applied to ten universities, all across the country.  At the time, I was somewhat arrogant, assuming that my 4.2 high school GPA would automatically grant me admission to everywhere I applied.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  I was accepted by 50% of the schools to which I applied, and to my shock, no in-state schools.  My overconfidence had left me no choice but to go out-of-state.  I chose Penn State based on its academic reputation and have so far been completely satisfied in that aspect.  This school has continued to surprise me, both with the number of opportunities available in research, extracurriculars, people, and academia.  There isn't a place like it and I'm so glad fate brought me here; I wouldn't have it any other way."
