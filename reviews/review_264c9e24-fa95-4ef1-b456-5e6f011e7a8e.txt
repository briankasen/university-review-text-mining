"NorthwesternUniversity College, as succinctly as possibly, has been a humbling experience. It was not exactly what I had imagined it to be, but ultimately, this is a good thing. Before journeying to the campus that I would spend 4 of the most important years of my life at, I had pictured myself with endless time at my disposal to work hard in my classes, participate in campus activities, hang out with friends, and take care of my personal needs. For the most part, I was able to do this. But it was challenging. My experience at college led me to understand that I had to truly learn about myself before I could acknowledge how I wanted to live my life. I'm fortunate that I was able to find an optimal balance in my life, but I've witnessed others who have struggled mightily. My advice to my high school self, as well as anyone transitioning to college, would be this: These are your formative years. The ones that will define who you are. So don't fill them with experiences that you may one day regret. Fill them with ones that you will cherish and grow from."
