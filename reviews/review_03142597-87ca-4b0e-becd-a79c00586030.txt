"UniversityOfIowa I love the University of Iowa. I love my classes, I love the teachers, I love the culture and diversity of the school, I love my friends, I love the campus, I love the city, I love the social scene. I actively care about what I'm learning in my classes and discuss my class material with my friends and family, and genuinely want other students to do the same with me. I wouldn't think about transferring for even a second; I know I made the right choice and I know that this college experience will be one of the best of my life."
