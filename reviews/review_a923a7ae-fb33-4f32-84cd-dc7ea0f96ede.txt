"NorthwesternUniversity Going back in time to talk to my self as a high school senior I would give my self some good adivce. I would advise my self to go to class everyday so that I am already in the process of going to school when needed. In college you have to attend school everyday your signed up to go if not its going to be a waste of money. Other advise is that picking a college is a difficult task and I would have advised my self to make a wise choice my senior year so I knew what I was going to do and where I was going to go. More advice Id give my self is that a big huge transition is doing everything on your own. You do not have professors telling you, you have a second opportunity to do your homework or test. My final advice I would give to my self as a senior student is to work my hardest to get my best grades possible. It truly does effect you when going into college because they do look at your grades."
