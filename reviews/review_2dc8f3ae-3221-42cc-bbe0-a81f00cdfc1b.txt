"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark University of Maryland is a LARGE school and because of this, it's very easy to get lost in the shuffle. The school has a lot of really great programs that are intended to help everyone find a niche, but the only people who benefit from them are those who take initiative. So, in order to thrive here (which I believe is possible), you must seek out the opportunities that are available to you."
