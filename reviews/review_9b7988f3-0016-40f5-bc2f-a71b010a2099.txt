"UniversityOfIowa Overall, I thoroughly enjoy attended the University of Iowa. Although it was not my first choice for a post-secondary education, I would not envision myself anywhere else. The overall atmosphere encompassing the campus is unbelievable and it feels as though all the students are a giant family. The academics are definitely rather hard, but professors and teaching assistants are always available to help students with any difficulties that they have."
