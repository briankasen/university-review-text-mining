"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark Overall, UMD is a great school.  If you're looking for a big state school with a good party scene, a lot of school pride and the opportunity to study whatever you want or take part in any activities, UMD is the place to go.  It's definitely not for everyone, but most people manage to find their own community within the school."
