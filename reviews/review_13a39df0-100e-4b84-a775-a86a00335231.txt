UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The University of Minnesota has a great education system and challenging courses with a sizable workload. I really enjoy the business school because there are lots of opportunities to learn about companies in the area and obtain internships. Though the dining hall food is not very good and the housing could be better.
