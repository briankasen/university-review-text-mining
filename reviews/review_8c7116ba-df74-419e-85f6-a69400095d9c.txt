"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Overall, I've had an incredibly positive experience at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I've been actively involved in multiple groups that fit my interests (there's really something for everybody) and the academics have been great. There's resources everywhere and the campus community is very welcoming."
