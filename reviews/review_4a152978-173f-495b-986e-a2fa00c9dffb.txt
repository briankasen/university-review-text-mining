"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan has not only top-ranked academics and sports teams, but Ann Arbor also one of the best college towns in the U.S. with a wide variety of shops and food within easy walking distance. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved and to try something new. There is a work hard - play hard mentality that can be found each football Saturday as 100,000+ people make their way to the Big House. The academics require work, but professors are more than happy to help and meet outside office hours. UMich offers the best of both worlds: the advantages of a big research university with a diverse student body and the opportunities to make it feel more like a small college. Great school, great town, great people!"
