UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln The University of Nebraska at Lincoln is a great school for those who are looking for a more laid back taste of Nebraska care and a big city. The campus life is friendly and provides a safe atmosphere for students and staff. The course work provides a well rounded approach to the topics and is somewhat rigorous depending on the area of study.
