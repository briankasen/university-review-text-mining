"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I do not necessarily care for this university. It is a good institution, don't get me wrong but it is simply not for me.  What I want to do with my life is something this campus, surprisingly, cannot offer. One of the deans here said to me that it would be best that I transfer because Madison is not the place for me."
