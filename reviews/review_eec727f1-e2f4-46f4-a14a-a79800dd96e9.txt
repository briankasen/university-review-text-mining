"IndianaUniversityBloomington In the words of our fight song, ""Indiana, Our Indiana"", the students of Indiana University truly are all for IU! In everything we do, from academics to sports to philanthropy to school spirit, Hoosiers always fight for the cream and crimson and for the glory of old IU. The faculty, staff, and career service advisors of Indiana are never daunted and truly strive to help every student succeed both in and after attending college. When it comes to Hoosier pride, we cannot falter: from tailgate season to Little 500, the students of IU go all out to show support (in the funnest way possible) for our teams, Olympic athletes, and coaches. In the battle for the reputation of best school in the Midwest (and arguably, the nation), we're tried and true. So few transfer out of Indiana, and our alumni network is one of the best and strongest in the country. 
With all my heart, the students of Indiana University honestly can say, ""Indiana, our Indiana, Indiana we're all for you!"" IU!"
