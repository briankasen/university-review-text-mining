"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison Absolutely love being a badger. I take full pride in having the Wisconsin experience and attending such an amazing school. The variety of people, classes, and extra curricular that are available are endless.  It’s my home away from home;I couldn’t imagine myself anywhere else"
