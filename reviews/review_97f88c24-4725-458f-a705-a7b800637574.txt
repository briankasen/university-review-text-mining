RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers is overall a nice school. A nice mixture of campus life and mini-city life. You'll find 1-2 professors to be good every semester on average if you're partaking in 5 classes as semester.  On-campus housing isn't very nice and the lottery system is extremely random. I prefer to live off-campus has the selections are much wider and I have more control in where I want to live.
