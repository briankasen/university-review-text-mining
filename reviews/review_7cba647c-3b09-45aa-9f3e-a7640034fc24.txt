"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln There were plenty of interesting people from many different backgrounds at UNL. If you're willing to reach out and meet people, there were plenty of opportunities to meet someone new. The 100 and 200 level classes were large, but as you moved into the upper levels the class sizes shrank dramatically and the professors become much more available and supportive. There were plenty of opportunities for employment around campus and housing was incredibly affordable. Unfortunately Lincoln pretty much a car town. You can get away with just a bicycle for everything except groceries, which are somehow not available anywhere near campus. For people who like to party there's plenty of opportunity, but if that's not your scene there's not much pressure to join in if you don't want to."
