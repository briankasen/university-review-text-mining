"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Penn State is an extremely strong academic school and is one of the strongest research schools in the country, it is very easy to get involved.  Since it is such a big school there are plenty of extracurriculars for everyone.  However, there is a huge emphasis on partying and drugs that have ruined lives, and the fraternities are not to be trusted."
