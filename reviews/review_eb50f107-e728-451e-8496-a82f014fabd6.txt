"UniversityOfIowa The University of Iowa is one of 3 college universities in Iowa. It is located in downtown Iowa City so students can access stores, restaurants, etc, which is good. It offers plenty of resources from researchers, career advice center, outside class activities, clubs, gym and so on as long as you are wise and know how to use them. However, we do party too much but is up to you if you want to get involved, I never did. I mean it all comes to the student whether you want to play around or study."
