"IndianaUniversityBloomington Indiana University-Bloomington is a place for everyone. The college has around 40,000 undergraduates and hundreds of thousands of opportunities for each one of their students. This school is truly a place for everyone and anyone can feel welcome and apart of something greater if they search hard enough for it. The only negative thing I have seen at Indiana University is that, since it is such a big college, information from the university to students many not be communicated as well as it could be."
