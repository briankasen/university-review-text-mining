"UniversityOfIowa University of Iowa was not my first choice, but after coming to the school for a visit I really fell in love with the campus and people. It is big enough to call a city and small enough to feel like you can get around without a car. Also the people are always so kind! Its one of the best college towns! Always something to do in Iowa City/on campus."
