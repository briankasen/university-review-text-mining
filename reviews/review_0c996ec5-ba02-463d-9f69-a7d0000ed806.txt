"OhioStateUniversity At first, I didn't think I was going to attend Ohio State. I had a sibling attend the school (who loved it) but I wanted to do something different than her, and I felt like it was too close to home for me! But once I got accepted, I just knew there was no way I couldn't attend Ohio State, and I'm so happy I made the decision to. I'm only on my second semester and I feel as though I've made some of the best memories of my life. I've met amazing people, gone to life-changing events, taken thought-provoking classes, and joined clubs that cater to my several interests. Ohio State has so many wonderful attributes, and I'm so thankful I chose this school to spend my first four years of adulthood at!"
