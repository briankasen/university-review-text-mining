"PurdueUniversity In my opinion, I feel like Purdue University is a good university for students to study and focus on their goal. There's not much attraction around but if you have a car you can either drive to Indianapolis or Chicago for fun. The Academic quality here is great, teacher cares about us. Moreover, we have the third largest recreational center in the US."
