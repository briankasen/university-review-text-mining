"OhioStateUniversity Ohio State is the perfect college for students looking for a strong community of diverse, driven students looking to put themselves in the perfect position to succeed after graduation. It offers so many options in terms of clubs and organizations. There is something for everyone, and if you want to start a new club, the university will 100% facilitate and encourage the process. I could not have made a better choice for myself. If you're interested in coming here, reach out to someone you know who is/has gone here and they will echo my sentiments."
