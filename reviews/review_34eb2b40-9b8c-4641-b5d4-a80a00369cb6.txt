"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I think it's a great school to go to but I think it could be more diverse. Besides that, the school has a lot of great resources to use for students at no cost. The school has 7 percent higher graduation rate than the national average. Additionally,  the campus is easily accessible for students commuting using light rail."
