"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison At first glance, UW may seem overwhelming with its massive campus and huge student population. However, there is something so unique about UW's culture that connects the students and the community together so it always feels welcoming. I know it sounds cheesy, but I think it's from the pride every student carries with them about our school. We all are serious about our education, enjoy lots of fun, are politically aware (you should have seen the streets of Madison when Obama was first elected president. Truly amazing), and we all live for the creative and weird thing that happens that week (be it the large group of boys who ran through lecture halls in thongs (professors just laughed along with us), learning how to Bucky, the Statue of Liberty frozen in our lake, etc). We are all together in this crazy college ride whether in Badger tailgates, binge study sessions at our 24-hour library, or in the long walks up Bascom will or down University Drive.  At UW, college is more than a place to get an education (a top tier education at that), but it's a place to really discover yourself, expand your horizons, and really belong as a student and as an alumnus."
