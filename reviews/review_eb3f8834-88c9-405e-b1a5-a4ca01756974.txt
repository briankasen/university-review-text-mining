"OhioStateUniversity Deciding to attend Ohio State was one of the best decisions I have ever made. As an out-of-state student, I was skeptic of the size at first, but there is no length Ohio State won't go to to make you feel at home the moment you step on campus. With tons of programs for freshman to get involved and meet people, a plethora of student organizations that all set up booths at the huge Involvement Fair, and the many opportunities to meet people in classes, in dorms, and just around campus, it's so easy to feel at home. Ohio State is definitely huge - but it also has just about any club or major you could want, making it so easy to find things you enjoy or change your mind if you don't love them. Getting involved and finding people who enjoy the same things you do really helps to make a giant school feel small. It's definitely not the cheapest option for college, but they offer so many scholarships for Ohio kids and out-of-staters alike, and in my opinion it truly is worth the pricetag. You won't find a better school spirit, better opportunities, or better people."
