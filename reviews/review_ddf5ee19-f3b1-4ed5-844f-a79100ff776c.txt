"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign If you want the best, most memorable college experience and also be academically successful then the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is the university for you. There are more than enough libraries for anyone to study for, plenty of fraternities and sororities for anyone to join and find the right fit for them, many restaurants that will always fill anyone's sweet tooth, and everyone on campus is very welcoming and always willing to help. I live about 3 hours from home and the bus company is very inexpensive and I can always travel home whenever I feel homesick or need some of my mother's delicious foods. It's easy and fast and everyone who attends this schooI still talks about it for the rest of their lives. I highly recommend this university to anyone looking for a school that will give them the best academic and social experience!"
