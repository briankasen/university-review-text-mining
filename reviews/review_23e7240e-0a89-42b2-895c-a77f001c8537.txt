"PurdueUniversity Very bad school.  Pumps out one dimensional tech school type students.  No appreciation for arts, culture, diversity or critical thinking,  A lot of racists in the Agriculture school especially.  Constant partying and drinking.  Located in the middle of nowhere I made a bad choice."
