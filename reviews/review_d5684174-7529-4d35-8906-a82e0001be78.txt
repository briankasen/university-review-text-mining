"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I think it's a great school! Being a Wisc. resident, the climate is a lot different than the actual city. Thereâ€‹ are people coming from all over, so it can be a bit over-populated with white people. The diversity could be better, but given the environment, there are few things for minorities to do besides the Black Cultural Center or other Multicultural events."
