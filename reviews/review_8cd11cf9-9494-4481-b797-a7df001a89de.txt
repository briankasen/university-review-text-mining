"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity I find it to be a very academically challenging university.  However, academic assistance/help/tutoring is easily accessible. There are so many great intern and career programs. Although it is large school, it does not feel so big because it has so much to offer its students of all interests.  It makes it easy to find your niche.  The school really is a close community., especially on game day!"
