"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities If you don't do this school right, you can be destroyed. There is no middle ground, its either incredible or absolutely horrible. I know so many people who are leaving because they didn't jump in right away, which is ridiculous because it does take some times to get your bearings. Its very easy to feel anonymous as you will probably never see the same person twice, even in class. I didn't recognize people in my lectures for the first half of the semester!"
