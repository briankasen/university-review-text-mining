PurdueUniversity I absolutely love Purdue University. I am an out-of-state student and I have absolutely no regrets coming here. I call this campus my home away from home. I always look forward to classes each day and learning more about my major and what opportunities I have for my life after college. Purdue Is the best school in my opinion.
