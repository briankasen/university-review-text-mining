"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor I had the best experience at the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor. I made life long friends and had professors who challenged my way of thinking and pushed me educationally. University of Michigan lives by the saying, ""work hard, play hard"". There is a lot of social activities to participate in but everyone takes their studies very seriously. You can't go wrong attending Michigan and becoming part of the Wolverine family."
