"IndianaUniversityBloomington I genuinely like this school a lot! I wasn't going to go here at first but when I decided to come to IU it changed my life! I love the professors, the atmosphere, the students and the town! There is so much to be involved in and everyone is friendly and willing to help!  I wouldn't want to be any else but a HOOSIER!"
