"NorthwesternUniversity Northwestern is large enough and diverse enough for most people to find a comfortable niche.  It has a great reputation with employers and draws in a solid recruiting pool.  While Evanston can sometimes feel a bit sketchy, overall, it's a pretty wealthy suburb with a good amount of college-friendly eateries, and a tiny bar scene.  Exciting update: Trader Joe's is coming to Evanston, which means no more overpriced groceries from Whole Paycheck (things that really only matter when you live off-campus and don't have a car)."
