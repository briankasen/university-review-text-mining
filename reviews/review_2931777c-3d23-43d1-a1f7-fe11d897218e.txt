"NorthwesternUniversity Looking back to when I was a high school senior, I would get more involved in my college application process. I would also advocated for schools to have a program to help students start the application process for college applications and scholorships.  A program that would provide a mentor to students that would like to continue their education, but need the guidance.  
The college application process was very confusing when I was applying, there weren't enough workshops to educate students about financial aid and the procedure to applying to college. I would tell my younger self, not to take any breaks between high school and college, to go directly to school."
