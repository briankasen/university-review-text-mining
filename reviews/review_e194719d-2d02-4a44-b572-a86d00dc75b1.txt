"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Good school with a big play hard/work hard culture. Most students work hard to keep up with their academics, and people love to go to sports events. Our football team is fantastic! People are generally friendly, and there are a lot of clubs and activities to partake. It's a big school, which means a lot of space and people to mingle with.  Penn State is a lot of fun!"
