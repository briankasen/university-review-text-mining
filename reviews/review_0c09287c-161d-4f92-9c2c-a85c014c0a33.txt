"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers University is an excellent institution for both sciences and the arts. We are known to have extremely difficult general science classes (General Biology and Chemistry especially) but the challenge pays off, especially for those who plan to take their MCATs, or other graduate exams. Rutgers is a great school for post-undergraduate preparation, whether you plan to attend graduate school or move straight into the workforce. With 40,000 students classes are very large, but as long as you develop a relationship with your professor yourself and take that responsibility, you will be fine."
