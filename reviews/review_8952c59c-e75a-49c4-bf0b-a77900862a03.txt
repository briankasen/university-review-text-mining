"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign My overall opinion of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is that it's a great school.  I would highly recommend this school if you're looking for the typical college atmosphere and like big schools. The academics challenge your abilities without being impossible, which is an important criteria to consider when choosing a school. Also, outside of classes there is always something to do. From all the clubs and extracurricular organizations, to the activities hosted by the school, you are sure to make friends."
