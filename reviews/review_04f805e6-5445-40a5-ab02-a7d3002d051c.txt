"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity It might seem huge and a bit overwhelming at first, however, you'll soon feel like home in this university. 
There are always so many things to get involved in and many new people to meet. There's truly something for everyone. The campus is beautiful and very diverse.
We are Penn State!!"
