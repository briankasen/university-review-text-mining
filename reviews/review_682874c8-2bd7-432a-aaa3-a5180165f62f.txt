"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark While it hasn't been long since I first started attending UMD, I found the highlight of my experience to be from the people I met. The community is comprised of various welcoming organizations and individuals who are willing to help out at any step of the way. The living conditions may not be the most uplifting, but the academics are worthy of praise. Like any school, it has its strengths and faults; however, those imperfections add to its character and allow students to bond over their impressions together."
