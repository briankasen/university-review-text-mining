"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln Being a first year student, there is still so much to learn about UNL. My few months that I have lived here, however, have been treating me very well. There is plenty for me to get involved in, and I can always find a niche of mine right around the corner. The classes are challenging, but in a great way! Facilities are over the top, always neat and full of plenty of resourcesâ€‹. I feel as if I have picked a good place to further my education."
