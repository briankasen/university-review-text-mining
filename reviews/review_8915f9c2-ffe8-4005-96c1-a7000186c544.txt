"UniversityOfIowa There is truly something for everyone at Iowa. If you have a fear of ""just being another number"" that is not the case at all.  There are groups to get involved in of all shapes and sizes and once you get into your major you will start to recognize familiar faces in class. Going to Iowa was the best decision I have ever made!"
