"PurdueUniversity Overall, Purdue is a large school with a small-town feel. Learning communities allow students to take the same classes at the same time (and possibly live together) to bond. Unfortunately, this can make it a bit clique-y, even for such a huge population. Professors are fantastic for the most part and you'll learn a lot if you seek the academic resources available."
