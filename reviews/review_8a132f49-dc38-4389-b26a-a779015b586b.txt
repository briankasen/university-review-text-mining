"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln In my specific college, (the music program), us music students are given lots of opportunities to make relationships with our professors. The class sizes are small which helps aid in discussions and the ease of getting more one on one time in class if needed. Along with the smaller class sizes I am able to make more relationships with my peers. There is always someone I can go to in my class if I need help. The university does a good job promoting not only music performances but also dance performances and art exhibits; promoting the arts culture as a whole. Although I would appreciate more funding to support repairing instruments and a more updated music building I think that we are blessed to have what we have."
