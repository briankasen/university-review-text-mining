"OhioStateUniversity I attended Ohio State my freshman year of college, but since have decided to transfer. OSU has so much to offer, but I think I was overwhelmed by the options and therefore never got involved. I often felt out of place, but I knew many others who found their place. OSU is two hours away from my city of Cincinnati, I was often homesick and bored and alone. I often went home because I didn't like my feelings on campus. I was placed with a junior as a roommate which also made things difficult, along with my floormates being cliquey, and my only friends living on the other side of campus. Academically, OSU is great. Socially, it takes a while to figure it out. Overall, OSU is a great school if you're brave enough for it."
