"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The U of M is the place I love to call home. You get the choice of the big city with East and West Bank, but for me, I get to have my small town feel with just a bus ride over to St. Paul. Overall, you can find what you need when you need it just by doing a simple search. The U of M is a place everyone can feel like they belong and offers so many different opportunities."
