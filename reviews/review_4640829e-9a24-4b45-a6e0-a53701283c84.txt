"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The university of Maryland may be a big institution, and although it is you can always find a  place in which you can fit in, which is always great. There is always a club you can join to make that big campus just a little smaller. Education wise, they do a pretty good job at encouraging you to do your best, although you also need to put forth some effort in order to receive help. Overall, I think that UMD is an amazing campus to be obtaining my education at."
