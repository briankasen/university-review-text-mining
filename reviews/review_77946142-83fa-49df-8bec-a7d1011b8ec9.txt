"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity The weather usually sucks here, but a number of awesome people make up for it. There are tons of interesting individuals on campus, and there are always events happening on campus. Each individual will be able to find their own crowd if they try to look for them. The size of the campus compared to the student population means that it can be crowded at times, but this can be resolved by taking courses later in the day. Overall the campus is can't be compared to the top schools in Pennsylvania, such as UPenn, but it's decent."
