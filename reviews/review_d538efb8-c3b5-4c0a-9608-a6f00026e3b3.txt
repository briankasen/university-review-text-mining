"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I love the University of Wisconsin Madison. Coming into my freshman year I was a bit terrified because of the University's reputation for rigorous classes and huge class sizes. As I moved into my dorm, Witte Hall, everyone was welcoming and eager to begin the year. I was able to make a lot of friends from my hall, classes, and when I went out on the weekends. Game days are also one of the best parts about the school. As you step outside your door on football mornings a sea of red welcomes everyone. I have never been anywhere that gets so hyped for their team. Iâ€™ll never forget my first game day experience. 

Overall I think the UW is an amazing place. The city has so much to offer and it is truly impossible to be bored there. Classes are very challenging, but it just takes an extra bit of effort to reach your goals. Every since I stepped foot on campus I have become very determined to make a difference in the world, this is partly due to the Wisconsin Idea. It is an idea that encompasses every aspect of the UW. Students are taught that their actions and education should be geared toward the goal of helping more than just themselves or Wisconsin, but the whole world. I have been an advocate of this idea since my first tour. I think it is a fantastic idea to put in the minds of eager students as they enter college. I believe the University of Wisconsin Madison is a fantastic place to live and learn."
