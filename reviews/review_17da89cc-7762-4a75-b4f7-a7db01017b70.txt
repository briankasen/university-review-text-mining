"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln My overall opinion of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is that I love this place. I love the diversity on campus, how supportive every staff member is and how nice all the people are. The best days during the Fall season has to be the Husker game day football games. The whole campus goes to the games and supports our football team. Just seeing the sea of red cheering on the team is inspiring."
