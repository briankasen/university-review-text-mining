"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I have no doubt in my mind that the University of Wisconsin-Madison was the right choice for me. I love being a Badger, and I especially love being a music student. While I love the big campus, it's nice that the school of music only has about 250 students. The class size is small and the professors are always very accessible.  The campus is absolutely gorgeous and I love that it's integrated with the city as well."
