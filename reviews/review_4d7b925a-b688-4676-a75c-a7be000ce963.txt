"UniversityOfIowa My overall opinion of University of Iowa is that there are opportunities everywhere and for anything.  It is a very well diverse school with hundreds of groups and clubs you can partake in. I really enjoy all the options there are for academics, which is mostly the reason I chose to attend at this school. Great place to explore your interests and expose your brain to the many opportunities."
