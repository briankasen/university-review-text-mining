OhioStateUniversity This school has been a major disappointment for me and my family.  My research said this would be a great learning atmosphere but I was mistaken. Ohio state is not interested in education but collecting money. I'm in Electrical engineering and there are no labs or hands on learning which is crippling in my field.
