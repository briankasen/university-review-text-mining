NorthwesternUniversity Northwestern University has done far more than serve as an institution for me. This school has provided me with a new perspective on life. I feel as though I am a better learner because of Northwestern. The most qualified professors teach here and it is such an honor to get to learn from them. Taking classes here is much different than taking classes anywhere else. They do not feel like tiring classes; people go here to gain real knowledge. The students here are wonderful as well; you are exposed to so many different ideas on a daily basis and I think that is what makes us so special. Northwestern genuinely cares about its students. There are also so many resources here to ensure your success. We have tutors and groups for every difficult class there is. We have an amazing career center to help with internship and job searching. This is one of the best decisions in life I could have ever made.
