"MichiganStateUniversity I absolutely love Michigan State University. From the beautiful banks of the Red Cedar River, to the newly renovated Brody Complex, there is something captivating about the campus. The teachers are extremely helpful and available. The class sizes are large, but that is expected from a Big 10 college. The teachers are very accommodating and want the students to be successful. There are countless clubs to be a part of and hundreds of ways to get involved on campus. There is something for everyone, and if someone is feeling ambitious they can go out and create their own club. All of these things combined make Michigan State University an amazing college and a place I am happy to call my home for the next 4 years."
