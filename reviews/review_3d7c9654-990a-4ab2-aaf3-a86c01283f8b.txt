"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark I love this school and have learned a lot about the world and myself, in and outside of the classroom.  I am surrounded by people who care about their grades, but are also willing to go out and enjoy life together.  The food and the dorms are not as nice, but it's a small price to pay for this great school."
