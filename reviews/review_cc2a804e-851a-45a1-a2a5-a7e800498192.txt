"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign My overall opinion of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is that it truly is a great school filled with tremendous amounts of opportunity. The number of clubs/sports that they offer is great for students because everyone no matter who that person is, is going to find a form of comfort. Comfort in college is a necessary thing that will make that much of a difference in the long run."
