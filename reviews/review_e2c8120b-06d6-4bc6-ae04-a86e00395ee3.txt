"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Most beautiful campus ever! I love the diversity and vast opportunities of going to such a large school -- there is something for everyone. But if you don't get involved, you might get lost in such a big, and sometimes impersonal, place. My professors, for the most part, are amazing and I feel like I'm getting an amazing education. Facilities, especially for athletics, are incredible! A lot of people join Greek life, but don't feel pressured into doing it because there's plenty more to do, and frat parties, although prevalent, are overrated and hard to get into. Alcohol is flowing here, the party scene is crazy! I'm rarely bored because there's usually so much to do on campus and in State College, PA, although it can get kind of expensive to always go out (there's plenty of people who come from wealthy families here, so if you're like me and can't afford all the stuff they can it can be a little frustrating). Overall, I really like it here, and I'm glad I chose Penn State!"
