"IndianaUniversityBloomington I am a junior at Indiana University Bloomington and spent two years living on campus. Living on campus at IU was the worst experience of my college career so far. Overall, I love IU because of the opportunities it has given me. I have been able to participate in many extra curricular activities and gain leadership experience."
