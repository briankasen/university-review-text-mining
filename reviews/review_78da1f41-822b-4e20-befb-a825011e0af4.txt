"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick There's a lot to do here in terms of academics and extracurricular activities. If you find yourself bored then you're not trying hard enough to get involved. For the most part people are nice but during party nights, drunk college kids are horrible! The bus system is a nightmare during snowstorms, exam times, and Thursday-Saturday nights. The food is very bland and it's up to you to season it with what they have available. But they have great options outside of campus that are affordable and fill you up. FAT SANDWICHES ARE THE BEST! Perfect for those Friday or Saturday nights where you're drunk and so hungry you can eat a horse or when you wanna chill in your dorm with your friends and scarf down greasy food. Housing is not bad. There's a lot of buildings that need new furniture and renovation. There's not enough housing to accommodate all of the students but luckily I've gotten a room all 4 years. If you're looking for apartments, the best options are Livingston Apartments on Livingston Campus, Sojourner Truth Apartments on College Avenue Campus, and Henderson Apartments (women only) on Douglass Campus. Cost of attendance isn't too bad. There's other schools in NJ that charge a full year of Rutgers cost of attendance (including housing and basic meal plan) for only a semester without the same global reputation that Rutgers has. It's honestly the best school you can go to in NJ if you can't afford or didn't make it into Princeton. I think I gave you a little bit of everything. Hope this helps!"
