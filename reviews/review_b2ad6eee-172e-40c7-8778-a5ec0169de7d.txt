"OhioStateUniversity I am currently a Junior at the Knowlton School of Architecture at OSU and I love it. This program is for the creative minds and is strongly based on theory which does have the shortcomings of not learning all the technical aspects of architectures but you will not get any better teachers. We are on a first name basis with students and faculty and it's fantastic because a lot of them are adjunct-faculty so they know the real world. Just watch out for Jackie or Kipnis, they are very strongly opinionated. OSU is a school that parties hard so if that's your crowd definitely go for south campus living. The food here is better than most schools and if you get sick of it Columbus has plenty of options! There is literally something for everyone here. Yes, campus parking services is a scam so make sure to read the fine print on EVERYTHING. If you are an african-american minority prepare for a small community. OSU kind of sucks on representing that aspect of diversity but they have plenty of Asian exchange students! Other than that I highly recommend this school. Apply for all scholarships because it's expensive af."
