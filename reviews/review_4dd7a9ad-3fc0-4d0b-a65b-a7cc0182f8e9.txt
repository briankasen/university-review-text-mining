"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison At first, I didn't like it because I found it too big and overwhelming. However, now that I've found my niche and got more accustomed to college life, I love it here! There are so many different kinds of classes and student organizations to join! The academics and student life are both amazing and living in downtown Madison is the best!"
