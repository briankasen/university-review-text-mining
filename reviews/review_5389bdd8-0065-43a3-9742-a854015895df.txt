"UniversityOfIowa It's a great school for academics and social life. During the weekdays, the libraries are packed. Students also have tutors in residence hall and classes that serve as study groups. On weekends, student are at house parties or exploring downtown. Its a perfect balance. The only thing that the university lacks is diversity."
