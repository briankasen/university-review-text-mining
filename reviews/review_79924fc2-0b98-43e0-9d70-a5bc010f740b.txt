"OhioStateUniversity I am in love with this campus. For beginners, the university has built a ton of new dorms so there are many nice dorms to live in. The off campus apartments and houses are also nice and both options have an amazing atmosphere. Academically, Ohio State is on par and continuing to advance past any of the universities in the United States. The sports speak for themselves, especially our beloved football Buckeyes. The opportunities and benefits at Ohio State are much greater than any other college in the US."
