"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I have found my experience at the university so far to be satisfying. My major has a strong program with very qualified faculty members. There are also plenty of clubs and activities to get involved in. The campus has considerable diversity, and there is most definitely a party culture if a student wishes to partake. Overall, I think UNL is a good school for a physics major like myself."
