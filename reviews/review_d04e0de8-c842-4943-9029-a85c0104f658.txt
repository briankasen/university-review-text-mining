"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers University-New Brunswick is a huge research institution that also has a business school with a very competitive reputation. With that being said, I find the academics at the business school to be rigorous and challenging. Many of the classes require at least 4 hours of work outside of the classroom every week, and exams are fairly difficult. Although classes are large, it's easy to communicate with most professors if you attend office hours and make it a point to be recognized. It's a Big 10 Athletics school so football games are huge and parties are definitely part of the day-to-day life of students. Overall, I feel that Rutgers-New Brunswick provides a great, well-rounded college education at an unbeatable price!"
