"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor I love UMich! I couldn't have chosen a better fit in a school for myself. There's something for everyone, and the culture on campus is extremely welcoming. People from all around the world come to the University of Michigan to study, and it's very cool to get to meet people with different experiences and perspectives and broaden my horizons."
