"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The University of Minnesota, also locally know as ""The U"" is a wonderful, welcoming campus, with many opportunities for people of all interests. The U has hundreds of student groups, as well as a vast spread of majors. While double majoring in biology and global studies, I feel that I have been able to learn more than I had expected. Through my science classes, I have gotten the opportunity to learn valuable lab skills, that allowed me to get hired in a research lab and carry on my own project. I am counterbalancing that major with global studies, where I am being challenged to look beyond the biological science to the social impacts. The resident halls were nice and well maintained with very positive community advisors. Dining hall food is better at some dining halls than others, but 17th Ave has great good. The U really tries to create an environment that is welcoming to students of all backgrounds, and I think everyone is able to find their niche, to make a large university feel small."
