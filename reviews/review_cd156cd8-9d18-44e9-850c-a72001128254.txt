"PurdueUniversity Wonderful university, great academics, nationally ranked in many areas. Close to major cities, both Indianapolis and Chicago are reasonable drives. Welcoming environment, college town in smaller-town area. Safe campus, continuously updated facilities. Loved my experience at Purdue. Boiler up!"
