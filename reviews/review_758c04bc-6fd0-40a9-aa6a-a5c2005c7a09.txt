"MichiganStateUniversity Michigan State University made my first year of college one that I'll always flash back upon. I am a first generation college student, which means I had no one who had experienced the college lifestyle and could help me prepare myself for what was ahead. For first generation students or even freshmen who still had no idea what to look forward to, its like being thrown into a pool and having to teach yourself how to swim. You might get tired, but if you don't want to drown you continue to push  because you know once you make it to the other side there's the best sense of pride that you've brought upon yourself. College has taught me how to be independent, confident in my work, humble, studious, and how to have effective time management. Even though I didn't have that preparation for college that could've been beneficial I would not change a thing. From the mistakes I've made to the long nights, because in the end I know that whatever it is I'M CAPABLE of making it on my own."
