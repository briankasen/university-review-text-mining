"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity I believe that I found the right campus because after coming from Lehigh Valley I knew that I was ready for the 'Big Life' I suppose. 
At first, I was very overwhelmed to see how big the campus actually is and realized how many students go there. At the end of the day, I made some good friends and will continue my education."
