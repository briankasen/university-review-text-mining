"MichiganStateUniversity You definitely get your money worth when you come to MSU. The atmosphere is welcoming and the academics are unparalleled. It is very easy to make friends since there's an activity or club for everyone. Though Greek life is a big part of the school, no one is pressured to join! Overall, I feel very much at home on campus!"
