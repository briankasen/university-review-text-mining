"OhioStateUniversity The campus is huge--it's like a city nestled inside of a city. Most students feel intimidated, that is, until they find their niche. While the large scale of OSU tends to make me feel anonymous,  it also allows for diversified classes, majors, and extracurriculars.  For someone fresh from Smalltown, USA, the colorful variety was refreshing. Yet OSU was never my ""home away from home;"" it was my place to work, not play."
