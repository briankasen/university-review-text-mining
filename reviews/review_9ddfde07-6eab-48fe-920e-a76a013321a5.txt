"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison The best decision I have yet to make was completing my undergraduate degree at UW-Madison. There are endless opportunities for students in all areas of interest. Students at UW take pride in attending an academically challenging institution that offers diverse course offerings and research opportunities. In addition, the gorgeous city of Madison is surrounded by two lakes that students often kayak, paddle board, canoe, or even sail on! (lessons and rentals are available).  Once the temperature hits 60 degrees, students flock to the terrace for some Babcock ice cream (made on-campus by dairy science majors), head to picnic point for a bon fire, get a few meals from food carts, or head to the Farmer's Market every Saturday. Badger tailgates for football games are something truly special in this college town! Every student can make their experience unique and find groups that they fit in with. After 4.5 years at UW I still have yet to do everything possible on campus! Best school ever!"
