"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan will make you feel at home within the first few days you arrive onto campus. For me, it was when I was walking through the Diag and talking to a few of my new friends of what our next four years here might be like. It finally hit me that I made the right decision when I was cheering at my first game in the Big House in front of over 110,000 people. Nothing can describe the emotions and feelings of being there for the first time, surrounded by your fellow peers, alum, and fans, so passionate about this school that we all are so proud to be a part of."
