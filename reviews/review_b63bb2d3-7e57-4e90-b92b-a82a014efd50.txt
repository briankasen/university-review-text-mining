"NorthwesternUniversity I'm only a freshman at Northwestern, so I honestly don't have the most experience here yet. What I do know, though, is that the sense of community here is amazing. Everyone on campus is very friendly and inviting: I have yet to meet a person here that isn't willing to help out or just talk. The school also has a rigorous curriculum, which is great for people who like to be challenged. The only down-side is that Northwestern works on a trimester system (although they call it a quarter system in case someone wants to take class in the ""fourth quarter,"" summer), where each trimester is 10 weeks long. Midterms are about 3 weeks and 6 weeks in, and then finals are in the 10th week, and it was a little overwhelming to take big tests so soon in the year when I was still trying to adjust to life on campus. I made it through, though, and I learned a lot from it, and I still would highly recommend Northwestern to anyone who is looking to challenge themselves academically and make friends in the process."
