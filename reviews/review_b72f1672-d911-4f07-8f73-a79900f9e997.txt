"OhioStateUniversity This place has it all. It's got world class medical center, engineering lab, and liberal arts programs. It's rec center, library, and sports facilities are all incredible. The oval is a massive central place where people hang out between classes. Food and housing is OK. The people are incredible here. Columbus is an amazing place, and campus is close to a ton of cool neighborhoods, as well as the downtown area. The professors are great. It is a large state school, however, which means nothing is handed to you; you have to reach out and take it. Professors want to know you and help you, but you must take the initiative. If you do, the school will shrink some, and you will get the tlc you need, and a worldclass education."
