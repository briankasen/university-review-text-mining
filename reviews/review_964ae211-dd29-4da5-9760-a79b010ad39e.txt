"PurdueUniversity Purdue University is a gorgeous campus with a very diverse population of fun-loving and hardworking students. There are hundreds of groups to join on campus which makes it easy to find people with similar interests. I found the dorms to be very agreeable. Not all dorms have air conditioning but there is only a short season of very warm weather so window fans suffice. Dorms are well maintained and I had a great RA and made friends with the girls on my floor by attending floor dinners and activates. Football is not terribly popular at Purdue.  Many students only go to one or two games during the season but people get enthusiastic for the basketball games, especially those against rival IU. There is a wide selection of dining courts to choose from that serve a wide variety of foods.  Lastly, I found the academic scene challenging but not impossible. The teachers and TA's are kind and eager to help if you ask. I would highly recommend Purdue University and am proud to say Iâ€™m a boilermaker!"
