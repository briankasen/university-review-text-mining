"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities Overall the University of Minnesota is a good college. The campus looks beautiful and feels lively all year round. There is always something to do on campus. The biggest downside is the residence halls. They are out of date and the dining halls are mediocre at best. Another downside is the campus being split up into Minneapolis and St. Paul. It makes getting to classes a bit of a trek. However, the campus connector runs frequently and makes getting to class a breeze."
