"MichiganStateUniversity I love MSU! It's not an inexpensive school but the experience is so worth it. There's something here for everyone with its diversity and many opportunities to meet and gain new friends. We're big on competition but we always help our fellow Spartans out. There are some personal things that we all dislike as a unit, like the parking (it's terrible!), but I wouldn't pick any other school to attend and hopefully graduate from other than Michigan State University."
