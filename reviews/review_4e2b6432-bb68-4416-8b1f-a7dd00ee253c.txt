"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The four years I spent at UMD have completely shaped my life outside of college and I couldn't be more grateful for the time I spent there, the friends I made, and the education I received. I can't say enough positive things about the school and my experience. I highly recommend UMD to anyone and everyone!"
