"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers University is a wonderful school. It has a lot of activities students can involve themselves in. There is a lot of study spaces and fun activities for people to take part in. It is a very diverse school, very diverse. Rutgers dinning is good. Its just like one campus that has very bad food, like not worth eating. We have many advisers that help the students and facilities that help students during stressful times or other major situations. Rutgers is there for their students. A lot of wonderful things come from Rutgers."
