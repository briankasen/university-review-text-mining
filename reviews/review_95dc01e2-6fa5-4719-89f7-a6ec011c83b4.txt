"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor University of Michigan is a very active school in every sense of the word, students are politically engaged, academically motivated, and socially inclined. Anything you can think to do on a college campus there is likely a student organization already doing it. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the party culture and extreme scholarship, but fear not, everyone is in the same boat. We were all big fish in high school and now we just have to find our niche. If you are willing to put in the work, and have some fun doing it, the University of Michigan is an absolutely fantastic place to be!"
