RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rutgers University is overall good school. The people are nice and the teaching is good. One thing I did not like at the school was the freshman dorms. The dorm I stayed in had a lot of issues throughout the year.  The Rutgers bus system is okay.  They need to work having more buses after the classes let out.
