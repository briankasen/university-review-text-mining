"PurdueUniversity I love Purdue University. It is a truly one of a kind school. There is so much for a student to do. I couldn't be happier. The only critique I have concerns Greek Life on campus. While I think safety is very important, I believe SARMA needs to give a little more freedom/independence to the chapters that are on campus."
