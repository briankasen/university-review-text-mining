"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities The university of Minnesota Twin-Cities is a great place to go if you want a very large campus in the heart of the cities. Other than that, I would not recommend it. The winters are so brutal, and even more so when it takes you forty five minutes to get from class A to class B. The professors won't even know you're name, and they don't really care because they see so many faces each day and in each class. There is no campus feel, and hardly any school pride. It's big, and in the city.  Two pros for vs many cons, in my opinion."
