"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick The best aspects of Rutgers are the research opportunities and extracurricular options. There are tons of labs in almost every field that you can volunteer in. There are also hundreds of clubs for pretty much every interest.  Because Rutgers is such a huge school, it can be tough to orient yourself and you need to make sure you take advantage of the resources available."
