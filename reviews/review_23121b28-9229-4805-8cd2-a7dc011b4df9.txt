"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison UW Madison is a place where anyone can find their niche. There's so much opportunity here and so much to learn. The campus is huge yet homey, as its nested between two lakes.  The students definitely embody the whole ""work hard, play hard"" idea; you'll find people out drinking every weekend, Thursday is like a Friday here, and sometimes Tuesday is, too."
