"MichiganStateUniversity My overall opinion of Michigan State University so far is great. I'm currently a freshman and I just finished my first semester of college. Michigan State is a great school, the academics is good, and there is plenty of things to do on campus. For example, clubs and organizations, sports, Greek life. I've meet some great people. The professors here are focused on making you understand the material. They take the time to go over something you may not understand. You can go to their office hours, or talk to them during or after class. MSU is great for academics, social life, making connections, and discovering yourself."
