"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison An amazing experience. If you want the full ""college experience,"" please, please, please consider Madison. Though I have only been to a semester of this school, I have completely fallen in love. The campus is gorgeous, the people are amazing, game days incredible, and the academics challenging. With State Street literally funneling onto campus, there is always something to do. Camp Randall is electric on football Saturdays. There isn't a moment that I've lived in those grody dorms that I haven't regretted my decision."
