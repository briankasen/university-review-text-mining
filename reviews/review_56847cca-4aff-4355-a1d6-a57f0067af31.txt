"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I  love my campus! There are so many activities to get involved in. Add in the fact that it's in the Minneapolis area with gorgeous views and lots of greenery, I am not disappointed. The on campus food might not be the greatest, but there are restaurants everywhere you look!"
