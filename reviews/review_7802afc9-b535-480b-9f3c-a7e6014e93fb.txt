"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Rude staff, especially at Student Financial Services and Accounting. Very large class sizes.  Extremely rude women in the transportation office.  Hell!  These women treat callers/visitors like criminals.  You're taken through a loop of menus that terminate in voicemails that never get returned.  Don't believe me?  Call 848-932-7744.   Don't waste your money here.  Seriously!  The food sucks! Dorms are hot and humid.  College Ave smells like marijuana most times.  Oh, and if you have food allergies, these guys don't give a damn.  They don't hesitate to tell you that your ""allergy free"" food they just prepared could potentially be cross-contaminated.  Save your money and eat at 711."
