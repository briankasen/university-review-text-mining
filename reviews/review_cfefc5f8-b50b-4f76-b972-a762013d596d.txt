"UniversityOfIowa The University of Iowa, overall, is a pretty good school. Personally, I believe it is too liberally based, in the sense that any opinion other than the one of the student body president is shunned and not recognized as an opinion. None of the teachers in the math department speak English, making it difficult for those who only know English to learn and understand math."
