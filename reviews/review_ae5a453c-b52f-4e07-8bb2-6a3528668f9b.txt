"MichiganStateUniversity It's not bad. I prefer the after class activities most of all. There's a club for everything. There are plenty of opportunities for on campus work, and they will hire anything that has a pulse. I didn't use many of the facilities. I'm not much of a studier, but they were always there if i needed them. The counseling center can be a bit packed and overbooked. The school's a bit pricey, but it's worth it if you're an in state student like me.  I don't know about out of state students though. I have yet to live off campus, so i can't make a comment on that, but the on campus housing is good. You will never be cold."
