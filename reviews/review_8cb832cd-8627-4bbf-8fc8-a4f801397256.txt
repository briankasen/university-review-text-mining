"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I really enjoy the presence of the University of Illinois campus, although, it is a large school, there's never a dull moment here, for there's always something to do. While, U of I, may have been rated as one of the top party schools by the Princeton Review, it is also a school where I have observed some of the most intense, academically-focused, and bright minds who don't easily get distracted by the conundrums of what some groups of students may be participating in over the weekend. The University of Illinois isn't just a big party school in Illinois; it is also where the most innovative engineers, inspiring teachers, caring doctors, and gritty lawyers come from. It is where the next generation of bright minds come from."
