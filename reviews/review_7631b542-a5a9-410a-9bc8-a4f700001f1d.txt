"IndianaUniversityBloomington This school has my whole heart. I could not have asked for a better 4 years in Bloomington. I have grown in more ways than I can imagine: mentally, emotionally, socially. Before going to IU, I wasn't really involved in the world or my community. Thanks to IU, I have learned how to be a better contributor not only to my community but also to society.  Indiana University challenged me every single day and moulded me into the woman I am today."
