"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I am so excited to officially become a Husker. The campus is extremely welcoming. It allows creativity and ingenuity to flow at all times. There are art sculptures all across campus, and considering that our downtown and haymarket areas are only a few steps away, there are many study spots and hidden gems that no one can find. Many popular restaurants surround our campus, and the dining hall food is pretty delicious as well. My favorite part about going to UNL is being a part of ""The Sea of Red"" every Saturday during football season. You can hear the roar from the stadium across Lincoln. These are some reasons I love UNL. It is my home."
