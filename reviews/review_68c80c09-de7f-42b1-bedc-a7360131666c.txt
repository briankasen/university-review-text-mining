"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor Overall, it's an amazing place. There are an incredible amount of resources to help you succeed. The university staff are helpful, and willing to work with you if you put forth the effort. The campus is a safe, welcoming environment. There's a club for nearly anything on campus, everyone's bound to find something that they enjoy. I feel challenged as a student to succeed, and there's never a day where I'm not facing new and interesting problems."
