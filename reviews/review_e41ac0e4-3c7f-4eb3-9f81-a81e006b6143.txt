"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick It the Best! I never knew how lucky and privileged I am until I found myself in another school that lacks services and facilities due to the lack of funding. In Rutgers, you will never starve. You will never find yourself unable to study because of lack or libraries or computer labs. The schedule of every facility (food, library, gym, coffee shops, and cinemas) everything really works perfectly with the student's schedule. The classes challenge you to think, which its great if you want to feel useful and like you're learning. Rutgers is always on the loop, and the students always have a voice."
