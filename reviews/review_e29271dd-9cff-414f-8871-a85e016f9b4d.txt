UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I really love UNL. It is such a big campus but it doesn't feel like it on a day-to-day basis. There are a vast number of opportunities available for extracurricular activities and also academically. There is a place for everyone somewhere. It is also always expanding and improving facilities on-campus so it is modern and works well for students.
