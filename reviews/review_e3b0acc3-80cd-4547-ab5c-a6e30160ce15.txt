"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan is definitely a global school. Our professors are always vastly knowledgable in their fields as well as insightful and helpful role-models for our future endeavors. Whether I'm in biology classes or philosophy classes, the rigorous standard for learning is always evident. And our professors seem to care about cultivating intellectuals; its not just an exchange of tuition for information. 

What's more difficult is connecting with fellow students. If you don't subscribe to the conformity that is forced upon you by greek life, then it seems you are left alone to the arduous journey of traversing the social landscape of college. Everybody was inviting in the dorms during freshman year, which is where I made most of my current friends (as a junior now). However, after we've huddled into small groups for the sake of housing off-campus, students (myself also guilty) don't try to expand their horizons and look for new friends and influences. Classes start getting heavy and students stick to their own, impeding chances for larger and fruitful social circles. The rigor of classes and current zeitgeist of independence and efficiency lead students to value being alone in order to prosper. At times, it seems like students only gather for mutual benefit or on the weekends for impersonalized partying. 

But at the same time, my bonds with the friends that have chosen and live with are strong and have become stronger. So Michigan comes with its baggage and it can get you down sometimes, but I don't think I would prefer to go to college anywhere else."
