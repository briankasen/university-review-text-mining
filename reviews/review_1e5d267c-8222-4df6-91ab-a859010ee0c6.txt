"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign If you want the best, most memorable college experience and also be academically successful, then the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is the university for you. There are more than enough libraries for anyone to study for, plenty of fraternities and sororities for anyone to join and find the right fit for them, many restaurants that will always fill anyone's sweet tooth, and everyone on campus is very welcoming and always willing to help.  There are so many clubs and recreational activities for you to be a part of; it's nice to have a smaller community within this huge population of students!"
