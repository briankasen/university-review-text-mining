"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is an excellent school, but may not be for everyone. There is not enough diversity, students  usually stick with their own ethnic or economic background. I personally did not enjoy my time here, which is why i'm transferring. The Dorms are way too pricey and they're way too small."
