"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark After looking into other schools, College Park was the perfect fit for what I want to do in the future.  Almost all the programs are highly ranked in the country and the professors are always around for students to look out for help. But, some of the dorms are really bad. For example, the University Honors students are put in the dorms without AC, which is kinda ironic, but it's fine."
