"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The University of Illinois is known to be a prestigious school because of its research-oriented teaching. It really is very academically driven which I appreciate, however, it is very segregated. There's a huge divide between the white students and all other minorities. Most of the minorities don't know the resources, nor how to find them, and it can be very discouraging -- especially when most of the minorities (African American, Latinx, and Middle Eastern) are put in far away residence halls their first year due to their own personal incomes. These dorms are called Florida Avenue Residence Hall and Pennsylvania Avenue Residence Hall (FAR and PAR for short.) Living far away and not integrating with the other white students does create a barrier immediately because, as Freshmen, they are required to live in the dorms their first year. The retention rate for minorities is low because they aren't taught the resources -- nor are they near them -- and they also aren't forced to mingle with the other students. Creating more affordable housing, in close proximity to the ""Six-Pack"" -- the dorms where most of the white students live their first year, would cause a more stable social environment. It teaches the young students that outside of their college bubble, diversity is everywhere. When they get out in the real working world it would also help them be able to communicate correctly with people from different cultures and would cause a better overall social living situation for everyone."
