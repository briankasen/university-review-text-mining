"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark University of Maryland, overall, is a great school academically. When it comes to room and board, it lacks. The diner food is not very good and the freshman dorms are pretty bad however the on campus apartments are pretty nice.  UMD is a very good school for the in state price of tuition and you're getting an excellent education."
