"PurdueUniversity Purdue University's main campus is a homey environment that you get familiar with very quickly while your affection for it gradually grows. You will notice that it is a small place  after your first two months, but if you like exploring little places that don't get a lot of attention but are still appealing, then you will always have something to do on the weekends because there are plenty of places like that around/at Purdue. As far as academics go, your expectations will be exceeded if you go into a STEM field, if not, then you'll be satisfied with your education. In that way, you can't really lose with Purdue's academics, they're solid."
