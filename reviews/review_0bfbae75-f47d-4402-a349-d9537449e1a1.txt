"NorthwesternUniversity “Isn’t it boring to see all A’s on your grades?”  In response to the question, I  retorted, “No, I like it that way.""  Honestly, that’s how I liked my whole life – controlled and free of failure.  That is why the wait to hear Northwestern's admission response was agonizing.  The questions rolled in my head: “How will I tell so-and-so if I don’t get in?” “What will people think if I fail?”  Fortunately, I learned that I would be on my way to my dream school, and as the pieces for my dream life increased, I was determined to juggle them.  I would study chemistry and marry a doctor.  We would have beautiful children and put our fluffy dog in the picket fence around our house.  My plan was thwarted when I received my chemistry grade.  My mind reeled, “C+?  I’ve never gotten grades like this.”  The even shook me, but it also prompted a realization I wish I’d known in high school: my successes don’t define me. I realized that I would never be everything I was created to be without running toward my passions and falling down and recovering."
