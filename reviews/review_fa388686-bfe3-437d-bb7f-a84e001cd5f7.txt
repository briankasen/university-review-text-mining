"PurdueUniversity Overall, there is nothing I do not enjoy about campus. I really enjoy that everyone is here to learn and to help each other succeed. I also love that everyone here, the professors, staff, and students, are always very friendly. Furthermore, if someone is in need of help, it is not hard to find and it is provided whole-heartedly."
