"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign As a first generation student, I was nervous at the thought of attending college. I have heard many things about UIUC such as it is a huge party school, and the class sizes are humongous. This made me hesitant on attending the university, but it was one of my cheaper options on my college list, so I chose to attend here. I have only been here for 3 months, and I am already in love with it. It is known to be a predominately-white institution, but it did not feel that way once you arrived on campus. There are many people from an array of diverse backgrounds that made the transition from high school to college not as scary. You will meet a new person every day, and every person tries their best to be kind to one another. I have attended protests protecting DACA students, and I have seen the excitement for RUSH week. The school lunch was good at first, but you get tired of eating it after a while. I thought that the huge class sizes would bother me, but it's not as bad as people make it seem because you can always attend office hours, or email the TA and they will respond to any questions one might have. Housing is really pricey, so i recommend finding an apartment after your first year to save some money. Overall I love it here and I am filled with so much school spirit. I feel proud to be part of an organization that is ranked high on education and has plenty majors and minors to choose from. It has a great atmosphere of a campus town, while being a safe environment for many. Proud to be a fighting Illini!"
