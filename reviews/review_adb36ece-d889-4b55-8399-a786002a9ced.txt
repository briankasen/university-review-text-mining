"OhioStateUniversity It's an amazing school and I'm extremely grateful to have ended up here. As a military brat we don't really have roots or a place to call home, but the Ohio State University definitely changed that for me. I have never felt such an overwhelming sense of pride and friendship at any other institution and I welcome anyone who wants to become a Buckeye."
