"UniversityOfIowa Going to the University of Iowa was by far one of my best decisions! The atmosphere, students, faculty, and the facilities are great and you never feel out of place. The day after move-in my entire floor had become great friends and we still go out together when we can. Not only that but there is always something to do on campus: from going out with friends on the weekend to even relaxing on your own and getting some homework done. 
The professors are also great here, they always make themselves accessible to students and if by any chance they cannot, the Teacher Assistance is always available as well. 
Safety on campus is something that should always be noted and at the University of Iowa high measures are taken to make sure students are safe. The only time I have ever felt unsafe or scared is when I walking from the Greyhound Bus Station to my dorm at night, but you could always call a university bus and they will pick you up. 
Overall, the University of Iowa is an amazing, large university. I even tell high school family members to check it out when looking for a college."
