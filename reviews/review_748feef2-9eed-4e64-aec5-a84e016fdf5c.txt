"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity Penn State has its good points and bad points. Overall, the school isn't bad, but there are many better institutions out there, and I'm sure of that. The school seems to allocate its impressive funding to go towards building new buildings instead of maintaining and renovating the ones they already have. Although the school tries to promote itself as being diversity oriented, it does little to acknowledge actual accounts of bigotry perpetrated both by students and teachers. In fact, the school does little to acknowledge any type of problem unless they are brought under public scrutiny and their finances are threatened. The school does however offer an impressive selection of majors and clubs that cover a broad spectrum of interests. There are some very nice, modern classroom buildings on campus, but those are offset by the old and rundown ones. Dorms are decent."
