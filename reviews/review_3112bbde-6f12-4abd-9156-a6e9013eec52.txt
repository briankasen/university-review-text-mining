"UniversityOfIowa Overall my experience at the University of Iowa has been great. I really loved my first semester of classes and they offered a great Workshop class that went along with my Chemistry course. I felt this really contributed to my success in the course.  The people on campus are very friendly and it was easy for me to make friends my first semester here. Classes are great, and they are't as intimidating as everyone makes them sound. The University of Iowa is really a phenomenal place."
