"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark If you're looking for a good education while saving your parents money (I'm an in-state student), this is the place to be.  It's not in the middle of nowhere--being near DC is great for weekend excursions, and some classes even use DC's proximity to get students to venture through the Smithsonians for that odd paper or two."
