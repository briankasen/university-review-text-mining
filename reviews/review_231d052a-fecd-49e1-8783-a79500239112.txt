"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities I love the atmosphere of the campus and how it is easy for students to access events and places through out the Twin Cities. I really like how the light rail comes through campus so students can easily leave campus and not have to worry about traveling afar distance to find transportation. I am also very thankful for the campus bus system because it allows me to get to where I need to go quickly and at ease. I wish that the arts buildings would be renovated in the near future like many of the other academic buildings. It seems like most of the academic buildings on campus have recently been or will soon be renovated and that the arts buildings are falling far behind. In the arts buildings, especially the music building, you will find chalkboards and other technology that is very far behind that of the other academic buildings. Technology and new learning environments are important even to arts students, and the students could benefit greatly from enhanced learning experiences and new technology."
