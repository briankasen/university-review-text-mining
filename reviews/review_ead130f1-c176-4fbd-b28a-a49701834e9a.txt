"UniversityOfNebraskaLincoln I love UNL and everything that it has to offer. There are so many different activities that you are able to be a part of, there is never a lack of something to do. The campus recreation center is an amazing place to hangout with friends and to get a good workout going, there are also many different classes that you are able to take. My favorite place on campus is the library, it a great place to study, or even to just hangout with friends and grab a coffee. I have yet to take a class that I am not fond of, and all of my professors have been amazing teachers and even with providing their extra time and assistance when I need it if I am unable to make their office hours. I could not imagine going to school anywhere else. GO BIG RED!!!"
