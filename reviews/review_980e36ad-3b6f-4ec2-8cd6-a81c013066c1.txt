"UniversityOfMarylandCollegePark The University of Maryland is an amazing school.  My whole family attended this school, and it really is a welcoming place.  The staff and community are really great, always welcoming, and helpful.  I was a transfer student to the University of Maryland, so when I first came here I was really nervous, but other students on campus were really nice, when I asked for directions.  Everyone looks out for each other, and I think that is a really good thing."
