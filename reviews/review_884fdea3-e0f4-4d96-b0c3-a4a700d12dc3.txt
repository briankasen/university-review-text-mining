UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor Great and a very prestigious university. There is a community for everyone to feel welcomed. The University does cater to students who live in Michigan but is constantly working for out of state students and international students. It also focuses on students who may be stricken with financial issues because that should not be a burden to take classes.
