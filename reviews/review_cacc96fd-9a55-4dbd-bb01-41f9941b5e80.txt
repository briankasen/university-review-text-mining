"NorthwesternUniversity Come into school with an open mind. Sure, it's absolutely fantastic to start your freshman year knowing you want to have a particular career and participate in particular clubs, and you should definitely do everything you can to reach your goals. However, don't let your goals limit your college experience. There are so many different opportunities at college to make new friends, join extracurriculars and intramural clubs, and take a variety of classes - be open to trying out something that you may have never thought to try before. It'll help you to grow as a person and enlighten you as to who you really are and even provide different perspectives that may be useful in reaching your ultimate goals."
