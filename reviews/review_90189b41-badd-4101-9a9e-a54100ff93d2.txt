"NorthwesternUniversity I absolutely love this school. I feel like this is one of he few school where I, as and engineering school, can TA a dance class in the school of communications. The relationships I form outside of the engineering school are some of my most cherished one. We have a very passionate student body and extremely high academics. The quarter system is very fast pace, but I love the variety it provides. In addition I you hate a class it is over much sooner."
