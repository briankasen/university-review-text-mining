"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign The University of Illinois is my home. I love it so much there. There's always something to do.  I can also guarantee that there will be a club for you to join. There is a heavy focus on STEM programs though. The buildings for STEM majors are very new. The humanities majors don't have as nice of facilities, but the faculty is still great. There are not many scholarships given out, but it is a hard school to get into so it's understandable."
