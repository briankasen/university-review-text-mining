"UniversityOfIowa I like it!  The campus is a good size . It is not too large that you get lost but it is large enough to have many options available to you. There is an east bank and west bank on campus. The west side is where the athletes and science (medical) students are. The east side has more of the liberal arts, honors and science (technical). The resources (tutoring centers) are the best! Most of the professors really seem to want to help the undergraduates (which is unusual for a Big 10 university). I think this is a great school for undergraduates. I highly recommend it!"
