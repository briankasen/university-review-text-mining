"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison My overall opinion of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is that it is a very well rounded school that gives everyone a chance to succeed depending on your personal choices.  Many people told me this was a school where ""everyone drinks all the time"", and I was very nervous about this aspect because I did not want to participate in this activity.  Once I got there and took classes in my major, I found many people that felt like me because they wanted to focus on classes/studying.  This made me feel comfortable with the university.  Also, there are many extracurricular activities to join depending on your interests, and the professors always had regular office hours or could schedule other times to meet with you for additional help (I have taken advantage of these opportunities numerous times).  Besides the fact that there is some drinking culture, the only other negative is that there is some ""snootiness"" students and faculty have; they think they are better/their opinions matter more than people who live in other parts of Wisconsin.  However, not many people feel this way.  Overall, its top rated undergraduate nuclear engineering program and in-state tuition rate were the main deciding factors for me to choose to complete my undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison."
