"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick Although many students don't have Rutgers in mind as a first choice, it is honestly a pretty good school. There are multiple opportunities and a diverse number majors to pick from.  I really appreciate the diversity Rutgers has because it is like no other school. There are plenty of clubs to join and activities to try."
