"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison The University of Wisconsin Madison is a second home for me, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in going to college. The campus has tons of things to offer, and the academic side of life is exquisite. The students are all very friendly, the professors are helpful, and the community loves the students. Sports, food, and the dorm life make things a whole new world to experience, and that is why I love my college. Go Badgers!"
