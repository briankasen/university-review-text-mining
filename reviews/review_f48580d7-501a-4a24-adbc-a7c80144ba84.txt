IndianaUniversityBloomington It is a pretty good school for education and to socialize with others. Helps you get out of your comfort zone and try new things. The professors I have encountered have helped me when helped was asked and were able to reteach in a simpler way. Also there are many things that i learned and experienced that helped me grow as a person.
