"UniversityOfMinnesotaTwinCities University of Minnesota is the perfect place to me.  The faculty really cares about the students.  There are a lot of opportunities for students to get involved and join research groups.  It is convenient for students because public transit is easily available, and despite the campus being in three locations it doesn't feel huge.  Winter is rough but the money you save from going there, you can spend on a good coat.  Also it is incredible for biological sciences and engineering.   The alumni are also very involved."
