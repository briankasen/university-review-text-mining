"NorthwesternUniversity It has given me more than I thought it would, in terms of experiences, friends, and connections. It can feel competitive at times, especially if you are in classes graded on a curve. But there are always wonderful, supportive friends to get you through the toughest exams, go out with you on weekends, and grow together with."
