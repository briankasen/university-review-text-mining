"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign I'm glad that it's the school  that I came to get my undergrad for. I've had the privilege of interacting with students from all over the country and the world. I've been able to learn about new perspectives, and share my perspectives on various topics, both within class and outside of the classroom setting. It's been an amazing experience so far!"
