"PennsylvaniaStateUniversity I think Penn State is a great school. Personally, it is not for me. The party scene is enormous. Professors do have office hours and have plenty of resources for help but it may clash with your schedule and your 500 other classmates may also come for help. It's very difficult to find everything as a first year student. There is no time to get used to this new environment. Some students may love this amazing experience. If you rather small classes and less of a party school, then Penn State may not be it. I am lucky to be in a nice dorm with good food in our commons. It's not a bad school but I do find myself stressed out and very overwhelmed constantly."
