"UniversityOfMichiganAnnArbor The University of Michigan is an amazing school to go to. The campus is located in the middle of Ann Arbor, which is always rated as one of the best college towns in the country. There is always something to do here, whether you're looking for somewhere to eat, go out and dance, or just for a fun activity like seeing a movie. In addition to being enclosed in an amazing town, the campus is absolutely beautiful. It sure is huge, but there's tons of free busing to help you get around. There are multitudes of housing options, both on and off campus. I will warn you that it is easier to get housing on campus as a freshman though. There are dining halls spread throughout campus, some being better than others. I always recommend South Quad and Mojo. The real reason most people go here, however, is obviously the academics. Umich is rated as the number one public university in the country year after year, and it's clear why. The coursework is challenging, but very rewarding and will clearly set you apart when you go to apply for jobs or graduate school."
