"UniversityOfWisconsinMadison I enjoy Madison’s very much. It is a great college town and I love the culture. The size of it can  a little overwhelming at first but once you find you’re niche it feels like home. There is something for everyone at Madison. The academics, athletics, and student life all rank among the best in the country and they deserve to be ranked as such."
