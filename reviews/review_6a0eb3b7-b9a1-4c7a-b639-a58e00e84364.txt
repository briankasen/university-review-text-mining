"IndianaUniversityBloomington Indiana University Bloomington is a campus that is full of life, adventure, activities, and academics. The campus of about 40,000 students is always bustling and is never dead. The large, nature filled campus gives plenty of opportunities for adventures, walks, and jogs and fails to excite, even after being here for 3 years."
