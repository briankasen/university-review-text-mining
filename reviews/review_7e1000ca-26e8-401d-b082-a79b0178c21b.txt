"UniversityOfIllinoisAtUrbanaChampaign University of Illinois definitely houses a varying spectrum of party-goers and studious intellectuals and never ceases to amaze me of their diverse student population.  A home away from home, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign can easily be known as the corn capital in our campus town and always has liberal minded individuals whom you can engage in amazing topics together at the local boba place. I have never been so in love with moving away from home until I came here, and if they improved their campus food, it would be 100% my favorite place to live away from home."
