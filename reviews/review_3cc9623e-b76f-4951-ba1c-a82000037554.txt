"RutgersUniversityNewBrunswick If you come here only for the money, you won't be happy.  I tried that, but ultimately this school wasn't the right fit. For some, Rutgers is home, but for me, it wasn't. It's a really big place, so be prepared to feel small for a little. Not everyone gets used to it, but if you're lucky you can get by."
